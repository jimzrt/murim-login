＃174화



“어? 화양검 진백양이면 은인이 죽인 사람 아니에요? 맞죠?”

순간 드는 생각은 하나뿐이다.

‘저 자식 주둥이에 진작 입마개를 채워 놨어야 했는데.’

저게 사람이냐, 짐승이지.

하지만 이미 늦었다. 청풍은 이미 목줄 풀린 핏불테리어처럼 날뛰고 있었다.

“유명한 얘기더라고요. 은인께서 치열한 사투 끝에 화양검의 가슴에 창을 빡! 피가 촥!”

제발 멈춰. 그만해, 이 미친놈아.

지금이라도 막아야 한다. 내가 황급히 입을 떼려던 그때였다.

“화양검한테 욕도 하셨다면서요? 손 떼, 이 새끼야!”

“……그건 또 어디서 들으셨대.”

“만나는 분마다 다 알고 계시던데요. 은인이랑 친하다고 했더니 많은 분들이 오셔서 이것저것 알려 주셨어요. 숙수님께서도 맛있는 거 잔뜩 챙겨 주시고.”

어쩐지 자주 자리를 비우더니만.

태원진가에 머무는 동안 이곳저곳 쏘다니며 많이 먹고 들은 모양이다.

‘덕분에 나는 좆 됐고.’

침을 꿀꺽 삼키며 천천히 고개를 돌렸다. 도무지 알 수 없는 표정을 한 적천강이 그곳에 있었다.

“오햅니다.”

적천강의 눈썹이 꿈틀거렸다.

“오해?”

“네. 진짜로. 정말로.”

“오해라. 그럴 수 있지. 무림에 떠도는 소문이란 으레 뒤틀리고 부풀려지기 마련이니까.”

건조한 목소리가 이어졌다.

“그래서, 화양검을 죽인 건 네 녀석이 아니다?”

“어…… 그건 제가 맞는데요. 그런데 이게.”

“그럼 더 들을 필요 없겠군.”

나는 말을 잇지 못했다. 불과 몇 걸음 앞, 붉게 타오르는 적천강의 두 손이 보였기 때문이었다.

후우우웅.

느껴진다. 어마어마한 공력의 흐름이.

냉기가 산산이 부서지고 사막의 열풍(熱風)이 휘몰아친다. 입술 사이를 비집고 들어온 열기는 폐를 태워 버릴 듯했다.

불과 몇 달 전의 기억이 뇌리를 스친다.

‘화염신장?’

맞다. 화염신장이다. 그러나 조필의 그것과는 궤를 달리했다.

그보다 몇 배는 더 강하고, 강하고, 그저 강했다. 적천강은 더 이상 살날이 얼마 남지 않은 노인이 아니었다.

그야말로 화왕(火王), 그 자체다.

“천륜(天倫)을 거스르고 화양검을 죽이다니. 네놈이 진정 사람이더냐?”

“자, 잠시만요! 거기에는 상당히 심오하면서 복잡한 사정이…….”

그건 실수였다.

사정 운운할 것이 아니라 대장로가 태원진가를 배신했다고 냅다 질렀어야 했다.

심오하고 복잡한 사정?

‘시바, 그것도 기다려 줘야 말을 하지.’

잠시 눈앞의 상대가 누구인지 망각했다.

화왕 적천강.

주거지 침입 및 방화라는 심플한 이유로 천 명을 태워 죽인 그와 심오, 복잡 같은 단어는 몇 광년쯤의 거리가 있었다.

화아아악!

빌어먹을 노인네…….

누가 화왕 아니랄까 봐 더럽게 심플하고 화끈하다. 나는 화염신장의 열기를 느끼며 눈을 부릅떴다.

‘주마등인가?’

느려진 세상 속, 화염에 휩싸인 그의 손바닥이 내 가슴을 향해 느릿하게 다가오는 중이었다.

조필의 화염신장이 사골곰탕이라면 저건 매운탕이다. 청양고추를 듬뿍 넣은.

저런 걸 정통으로 맞았다가는 목숨을 장담할 수 없다.

‘막아야 하는데.’

문제는 손가락 하나 까딱할 수 없다는 거다.

세상 만물이 느릿하게 흘러가는 건 죽음의 위기를 인식한 뇌의 영향일 뿐, 적천강이 느려지거나 내가 빨라졌기 때문이 아니다.

‘염병할.’

필사적으로 손을 들어 올렸지만 이미 늦었다.

어두컴컴한 절망 속, 붉게 타오르는 적천강의 손바닥이 눈동자에 가득 들어온 그 순간이었다.

쐐애애애액! 쾅!

난데없이 쏘아진 한 줄기 검기가 적천강의 손을 후려쳤다.

선명한 자줏빛의 검기. 바로 청풍이다. 굉음 너머로 녀석의 외침이 들렸다.

“은인!”

절박한 외침. 적천강의 화염신장은 청풍의 검기로도 막아 낼 수 없었다. 아주 잠깐 속도를 늦췄을 뿐이다.

하지만 무릇 생사의 갈림길은 바로 그 찰나에 나뉜다.

‘지금!’

단전에 똬리를 튼 45년의 공력이 기지개를 켰다. 들불처럼 일어난 열양지기가 수많은 혈도를 따라 솟구친다.

목적지는 두 손. 나는 적천강의 화염신장을 향해 있는 힘껏 손을 내뻗었다.

‘빌어먹을. 무기를 꺼낼 틈도 없어.’

화염신장을 상대로 고작 생각해 낸 게 맨손이라니.

분명 미친 짓이지만…… 그나마 지금 상황에서 내가 할 수 있는 최선의 미친 짓이다.

나는 마음 깊숙한 곳에서 우러나오는 포효를 내질렀다.

“청풍 이 개애새끼야아아!”

마침내 화염신장과 손을 맞닿은 그 순간.

고오오옹.

귀가 먹먹해지는 파공음이 터져 나왔다.



* * *



하늘이 쪼개지는 듯한 굉음. 잠깐의 고요가 흐른 뒤 변화가 시작됐다.

파스스스.

재가 되어 흩날린다. 십 년 전 정성껏 쌓아 올린 돌담, 마당 한구석에 심어 놓은 나무 몇 그루. 그 모든 것이.

나풀거리던 검은 잿가루가 노인의 흰 머리 위로 떨어졌다.

“이, 이게 무슨…….”

노인, 장태보는 부들부들 떨리는 몸을 주체할 수 없었다.

강산이 여섯 번 변하고도 남을 장구한 세월을 무림에서 보낸 그다.

무공을 익히지 않은 야장(冶匠)에 불과했으나 그렇기에 오히려 수많은 이들을 만날 수 있었다.



‘이렇게 간청드립니다. 원하신다면 제 목이라도 드리지요!’

‘천하제일의 명검을 만들어 주시오.’

‘그대가 철기방주가 맞는가? 부마도위(駙馬都尉)께서 보내서 왔네.’



얼뜨기 무인부터 내로라하는 명문 대파의 주인들. 거기에 더해 황실의 권력자들까지.

장태보를 찾는 사람들은 각양각색이었지만 그의 대답은 항상 같았다.



‘자격이 되면 만들어 드리겠소.’



장태보는 모든 날붙이에 혼(魂)이 있다고 믿었다.

뭉툭하고 둥그런 쇳덩이가 형태를 갖추기 위해서는 수천, 수만 번의 고난을 겪어야 한다. 수없이 구부러지고, 두들겨 맞고. 뜨겁게 달아올랐다가 차갑게 식는다.

그 오랜 인고의 과정 끝에 형태를 갖췄을 때, 그것은 비로소 혼을 갖게 되는 것이다.

‘그러니 병장기에게 걸맞은 주인을 골라 주는 것도 내 업이겠지.’

누구의 손에 쥐어지느냐에 따라 살검(殺劍)이 될 수도, 혹은 활검(活劍)이 되기도 한다.

장태보는 그 사실을 아주 잘 알고 있었고, 그렇기에 그 어떤 의뢰도 허투루 받지 않았다.

‘성품이 온화한 자, 야심이 넘치는 자, 오롯이 자신만의 길을 가려는 자…….’

백인백색(百人百色)이라 했던가. 지금껏 각기 다른 수많은 이들이 그에게서 병장기를 받아 무림으로 돌아갔다.

더러는 죽고, 더러는 살아남았지만 그들에게는 한 가지 공통점이 있었다.

‘강했다. 그들 모두가.’

그들은 능히 한 지역의 패자가 될 만한 고수들이었다.

모두가 탐낼 만한 보물을 지키고 자신들만의 방식대로 사용할 수 있는 강자들.

그중에는 구파일방과 천하오대세가의 수장들에 비견될 만한 무공을 지닌 이들도 존재했다.

그러나…….

‘이건, 이자는 달라.’

화왕(火王) 적천강.

저 작달막한 체구에서 뿜어져 나온 기세와 무공은 이미 인간의 것이 아니었다.

또한, 그에게는 어떤 병장기도 필요 없을 것이란 사실도 깨달았다.

‘저자의 무공이 하늘에 닿았구나.’

무엇을 쥐든, 쥐고 있지 않든 그것은 이미 중요하지 않다.

그저 막연히 생각해 왔던 초절정의 경지란 그런 것이었다.

“후우우.”

장태보는 참았던 숨을 토해 냈다. 몸에 힘이 풀리자 품 안에 있던 물건이 툭 떨어졌다.

광물이라고는 믿기지 않을 만큼 단단하고 가벼운 그것은 한낮임에도 은은한 빛을 뿌리고 있었다.

“어이쿠!”

최후이자 일평생의 역작으로 재탄생할 보물이다. 황급히 만년한철을 주워 품에 끌어안은 그가 멈칫했다.

정신이 돌아오자 문득 잊고 있던 사실 하나가 떠오른 것이다. 바로 의뢰인의 존재였다.

“이, 이보시오! 그만하시오! 멈추란 말이오!”

자리에서 일어난 장태보가 헐레벌떡 달려갔다.

적천강의 발밑, 옷이 전부 타 버려 알몸으로 쓰러져 있는 청년에게는 일체의 미동도 느껴지지 않았다.

“주, 죽은 거요?”

적천강은 대답하지 않았다. 그저 무섭도록 딱딱하게 굳은 얼굴로 자신의 손과 청년을 번갈아 응시할 뿐이었다.

“뭐라고 말 좀 해 보시오!”

“…….”

“이, 이자가!”

분통을 터트린 장태보가 청년, 진태경의 상태를 살피려던 그 순간이었다.

“안 죽었어요. 내상을 입고 잠깐 혼절한 것뿐이에요.”

그를 가로막은 맑은 목소리의 주인이 말을 이었다.

“그렇죠, 적 할아버지?”

“……그래.”

마침내 흘러나온 적천강의 목소리는 잔뜩 쉬어 있었다.

그의 한 마디, 한 마디에 그가 느낀 놀라움과 복잡한 감정이 고스란히 드러났다.

“애초에 죽일 생각도 없었다.”

청풍과 장태보가 안도의 한숨을 내쉬던 그때, 적천강이 짤막한 한마디를 보탰다.

“지금까지는 말이다.”

“……!”

“……!”

“걱정 말거라. 모든 건 추후 자세한 이야기를 들어 본 후 정할 테니.”

적천강이 묘한 눈빛으로 쓰러져 있는 진태경을 응시했다.

“이 녀석에게 물어볼 게 아주 많거든.”

언뜻 위험하게까지 들리는 그 말에 장태보가 나섰다.

화왕의 무위를 직접 목격했음에도 세월이 만들어 낸 단단한 심지를 흔들지는 못했다.

“고문이라도 하겠다는 소리로 들리는구려.”

“그런 취미는 없지만. 필요하다면야.”

“저 청년이 누구인지 몰라서 하는 소리요? 당신이 아무리 십왕(十王)에 속한 고수라 하나 산서 무림 전체를 적으로 돌리고도 무사할 거라 생각했다면 크나큰 착각이오!”

적천강이 피식 웃었다.

“한때 십만 군세를 앞세워 천하의 절반을 집어삼킨 놈들이 있었지. 내가 놈들을 두려워했을 성싶은가?”

“……!”

장태보는 말문이 막혔다.

맞다, 상대는 화왕이다. 한때 천하를 호령하려던 마교와 홀로 맞서 싸운 구화산의 노괴(老怪).

정(正), 사(邪), 마(魔). 그 어디에도 속하지 않았던 그는 스스로를 전쟁의 저울추 위에 올려놨다.

이유는 간단했다. 자신의 영역을 침범했기 때문에.

적천강은 불그스름한 눈으로 장태보를 응시했다.

“부탁 하나만 하지. 부디 아무에게도 도움을 청하지 말게. 이 나이에 산서 무림을 불태우고 싶지는 않으니까.”

이 말은 진심이다. 그리고 그에게는 말을 사실로 바꿀 만한 힘이 있었다.

“알았나?”

“며, 명심하겠소.”

“현명한 처사일세.”

적천강이 씩 웃으며 돌아서자 장태보는 다리에 힘이 쫙 풀렸다. 쓰러지려는 그를 붙잡은 청풍이 물었다.

“어디 가세요?”

“네 녀석들이 묵었던 객잔이 있을 것 아니냐? 미리 가 있을 테니 따라오거라.”

서서히 멀어지는 적천강의 뒷모습을 바라보던 청풍이 푸념처럼 중얼거렸다.

“휴, 할아버지 말씀이 맞아요. 저분 성격 진짜 이상하네요.”

진태경이 들었으면 입마개를 잡았을 소리를 태연하게 내뱉은 그가 장태보를 향해 꾸벅 허리를 숙였다.

“폐 많이 끼쳤습니다. 그럼 이만 가 볼게요.”

그리고는 양 옆구리에 진태경과 혁무진을 턱 끼더니 야무진 발걸음으로 호다닥 뛰쳐나갔다.

한동안 귀신에 홀린 듯 서 있던 장태보는 얼마 지나지 않아 잠시 잊고 있던 중대한 사실을 깨달았다.

‘화왕, 이런 빌어먹을 늙은이를 봤나.’

패악질도 정도껏 해야지.

주춧돌만 남기고 죄다 태워 버렸다. 사방에 흩날리는 잿가루를 멍하니 쳐다보던 그는 한숨을 푹 내쉬었다.

“니미, 여기도 이제 끝이구먼.”

꿀 같은 은퇴 생활에 종지부를 찍는 순간이었다.

# Chapter 174

“Wait? Blade of Flowers Jin Baekyang—isn’t he the person you killed, Benefactor? Right?”

I had only one thought.

*I should have muzzled that bastard’s mouth a long time ago.*

Was he even human? He was a beast.

But it was already too late. Cheongpung was rampaging like an unleashed pit bull terrier.

“It’s a famous story. After a fierce struggle, Benefactor drove a spear straight into Blade of Flowers’s chest—bam! Blood sprayed everywhere—splat!”

*Please stop. Enough, you lunatic.*

I had to stop him before it was too late. I was just about to hurriedly open my mouth when—

“I heard you even cursed at Blade of Flowers. ‘Take your hands off me, you son of a bitch!’”

“…”

“Where did you hear that, too?”

“Everyone I met seemed to know about it. When I said I was close to Benefactor, lots of people came over and told me all kinds of things. The cook even packed me a ton of delicious food.”

No wonder he kept disappearing so often.

While staying with the Jin Family of Taiyuan, he must have wandered all over the place, eating and listening to people’s stories.

*Thanks to him, I’m fucked.*

I swallowed hard and slowly turned my head.

Jeok Cheongang stood there with an utterly unreadable expression.

“It’s a misunderstanding.”

Jeok Cheongang’s eyebrow twitched.

“A misunderstanding?”

“Yes. Truly. It really is.”

“A misunderstanding. That can happen. Rumors that circulate through the Murim are always twisted and exaggerated.”

His dry voice continued.

“So you weren’t the one who killed the Blade of Flowers?”

“Uh… I was, actually. But the thing is—”

“Then there’s no need to hear more.”

I could not finish my sentence.

Just a few steps away, I saw Jeok Cheongang’s hands burning red.

*Whooosh.*

I could feel it.

An overwhelming flow of internal energy.

The cold shattered into pieces, and a desert’s hot wind whipped around us. The heat forcing its way between my lips felt as though it would burn my lungs away.

A memory from only a few months ago flashed through my mind.

*The Flame Divine Palm?*

That was right. It was the Flame Divine Palm.

But it was on an entirely different level from Jopil’s.

Several times stronger. Stronger, stronger, and simply stronger.

Jeok Cheongang was no longer an old man who did not have much longer to live.

He was the Fire King incarnate.

“You violated the sacred bonds of kinship and killed the Blade of Flowers. Are you truly human?”

“W-wait a moment! There are some very profound and complicated circumstances behind that…”

That had been a mistake.

Instead of talking about profound circumstances, I should have shouted that the Head Elder had betrayed the Jin Family of Taiyuan.

Profound and complicated circumstances?

*Shit, you have to let me explain before you decide anything.*

For a moment, I forgot who I was dealing with.

The Fire King, Jeok Cheongang.

He was the man who had burned a thousand people to death over the simple matter of trespassing on his home and setting it on fire. Words like *profound* and *complicated* were light-years away from him.

*Whooosh!*

*Damn old man…*

No wonder they called him the Fire King. He was ridiculously straightforward and fiery as hell.

Feeling the heat of the Flame Divine Palm, I opened my eyes wide.

*Is my life flashing before my eyes?*

In the slowed-down world, his palm, engulfed in flames, was moving sluggishly toward my chest.

If Jopil’s Flame Divine Palm had been beef-bone soup, this was spicy fish stew—loaded with hot green chilies.

If I took a direct hit from that, I could not guarantee I would survive.

*I have to block it.*

The problem was that I could not even move a finger.

The reason everything in the world seemed to be moving slowly was simply that my brain had recognized the threat of death. It was not because Jeok Cheongang had slowed down or I had sped up.

*Damn it.*

I desperately tried to raise my hand, but it was already too late.

In the darkness of despair, Jeok Cheongang’s burning red palm filled my vision.

That was when—

*Shiiiiiiik! Boom!*

A streak of Sword Energy shot out of nowhere and struck Jeok Cheongang’s hand.

Clear violet Sword Energy.

It was Cheongpung.

Beyond the thunderous explosion, I heard his cry.

“Benefactor!”

It was a desperate shout.

Even Cheongpung’s Sword Energy could not stop Jeok Cheongang’s Flame Divine Palm. It merely slowed it down for the briefest moment.

But the crossroads between life and death was always decided in that instant.

*Now!*

The forty-five years of internal energy coiled within my dantian stretched awake.

Scorching Yang Qi rose like a wildfire, surging along countless acupoints.

Its destination was both my hands.

I thrust them forward with all my strength toward Jeok Cheongang’s Flame Divine Palm.

*Damn it. I don’t even have time to draw a weapon.*

All I had managed to think of against the Flame Divine Palm was using my bare hands.

It was obviously insane, but it was the best kind of insanity I could manage in this situation.

I let out a roar from the depths of my soul.

“Cheongpung, you son of a biiiiitch!”

At last, my hands met the Flame Divine Palm.

*Gooooong.*

A deafening sound of splitting air erupted.

* * *

The sky seemed to split apart with a thunderous boom.

After a brief silence, the changes began.

*Fssssss.*

They crumbled into ash and scattered through the air.

The stone wall Jang Taebo had carefully built ten years ago. The few trees he had planted in one corner of the yard.

All of it.

Black ash fluttered down over the old man’s white hair.

“W-what in the world…”

The old man, Jang Taebo, could not control his trembling body.

He had spent a long lifetime in the Murim—long enough for the mountains and rivers to have changed six times over, and then some.

He was no more than a blacksmith who had never learned martial arts. But precisely because of that, he had been able to meet countless people.

*“I beg you like this. If you wish, I’ll even give you my head!”*

*“Make me the finest sword under heaven.”*

*“Are you really the Guild Leader of the Ironcraft Guild? I was sent here by the Imperial Son-in-Law.”*

From clueless martial artists to the leaders of renowned sects and great factions. Powerful figures from the imperial court had come as well.

The people who sought out Jang Taebo were all different, but his answer was always the same.

*“If you are worthy, I will make one for you.”*

Jang Taebo believed that every blade had a soul.

For a blunt, rounded lump of metal to take shape, it had to endure thousands, tens of thousands, of hardships. It was bent countless times and beaten again and again. It was heated until it glowed, then cooled until it was cold.

Only after that long process of endurance, once it had finally taken shape, did it gain a soul.

*So choosing a master worthy of a weapon must be part of my duty as well.*

Depending on whose hands held it, a sword could become a killing sword or a life-saving sword.

Jang Taebo knew that better than anyone, and so he never accepted a commission carelessly.

*Someone with a gentle nature. Someone overflowing with ambition. Someone determined to walk only his own path…*

They said no two people were alike. Countless people, each different from the last, had received weapons from him and returned to the Murim.

Some had died. Others had survived.

But they had shared one thing.

*They were strong. Every last one of them.*

They had been masters capable of becoming the overlords of entire regions.

Powerful people who could guard treasures everyone coveted and use them however they pleased.

Some had possessed martial arts that could be compared to those of the leaders of the Nine Sects and One Gang and the Five Great Families.

But…

*This one… this man is different.*

The Fire King, Jeok Cheongang.

The aura and martial arts that had erupted from that short, squat frame were no longer human.

Jang Taebo also realized that Jeok Cheongang would never need a weapon.

*His martial arts have reached the heavens.*

Whether he held something or not no longer mattered.

That was what the Supreme Peak realm he had vaguely imagined must be like.

“Phew.”

Jang Taebo exhaled the breath he had been holding.

As the strength left his body, the object tucked against his chest slipped to the ground.

It was so hard and light that it could hardly be believed to be a mineral, and it gave off a gentle glow even in broad daylight.

“Good grief!”

It was the treasure that would be reborn as his final masterpiece—the greatest work of his entire life.

Jang Taebo hurriedly picked up the Ten-Thousand-Year Cold Iron and pulled it against his chest.

Then he froze.

As his mind returned, he suddenly remembered something he had forgotten.

His client.

“W-wait! Stop! I said stop!”

Jang Taebo got to his feet and rushed forward.

At Jeok Cheongang’s feet, a young man lay sprawled on the ground. His clothes had all burned away, leaving him naked, and he did not move at all.

“I-is he dead?”

Jeok Cheongang did not answer.

He merely stared back and forth between his own hands and the young man, his face hardened into something terrifyingly rigid.

“Say something!”

“…”

“Y-you…!”

Jang Taebo exploded in frustration and was just about to examine the young man—Jin Taekyung’s—condition when a clear voice stopped him.

“He’s not dead. He only lost consciousness for a moment after suffering an Internal Injury.”

The owner of the voice continued,

“Right, Grandpa Jeok?”

“…”

At last, Jeok Cheongang’s voice emerged, hoarse and raspy.

Every word revealed the surprise and complicated emotions he had experienced.

“I never intended to kill him in the first place.”

Just as Cheongpung and Jang Taebo let out relieved sighs, Jeok Cheongang added one brief sentence.

“That was until now.”

“…”

“…”

“Don’t worry. I’ll decide everything after hearing the full story later.”

Jeok Cheongang stared at the fallen Jin Taekyung with a strange look in his eyes.

“I have a lot to ask this boy.”

The words sounded dangerous enough that Jang Taebo stepped forward.

Even after witnessing the Fire King’s martial prowess firsthand, the unyielding will forged by his long years did not waver.

“That sounds like you intend to torture him.”

“I don’t have that hobby. But if necessary…”

“Do you not know who this young man is? Even if you are a master counted among the Ten Kings, it would be a grave mistake to think you could turn all of Shanxi’s Murim against yourself and remain unscathed!”

Jeok Cheongang let out a quiet snort.

“There were once people who swallowed half the world with an army of one hundred thousand. Do you think I was afraid of them?”

“…”

Jang Taebo was left speechless.

That was right. His opponent was the Fire King.

The old monster of Mount Jiuhua who had once fought alone against the Demonic Cult when it sought to rule the world.

Orthodox, unorthodox, or demonic—he belonged to none of them.

He had thrown his own weight onto the scales of war.

The reason was simple.

They had invaded his territory.

Jeok Cheongang stared at Jang Taebo with reddish eyes.

“I have one request. Please, do not ask anyone for help. I don’t want to burn down Shanxi’s Murim at my age.”

He meant it.

And he possessed the power to turn his words into reality.

“Understood?”

“I-I’ll bear it in mind.”

“A wise decision.”

Jeok Cheongang gave him a crooked grin and turned away.

All the strength suddenly left Jang Taebo’s legs. As he began to fall, Cheongpung caught him and asked,

“Where are you going?”

“There’s an inn where you lot were staying, isn’t there? I’ll go ahead. Follow me.”

Cheongpung watched Jeok Cheongang’s back slowly recede and muttered plaintively,

“Whew. Grandfather was right. That man’s personality really is strange.”

He said it so calmly that, if Jin Taekyung had heard him, he would have reached for a muzzle.

Cheongpung turned toward Jang Taebo and bowed deeply at the waist.

“Sorry for causing you so much trouble. We’ll be going now.”

Then he tucked Jin Taekyung and Hyuk Mujin under his arms and scampered away with brisk, purposeful steps.

Jang Taebo stood there for a while as though he had been bewitched by a ghost.

Before long, he realized the crucial fact he had momentarily forgotten.

*The Fire King. What the hell is wrong with that old bastard?*

There had to be limits to such outrageous behavior.

He had burned everything down, leaving nothing but the foundation stones.

Staring blankly at the ash drifting in every direction, Jang Taebo let out a deep sigh.

“Fuck. This place is done for too.”

That was the moment his sweet retirement came to an end.
