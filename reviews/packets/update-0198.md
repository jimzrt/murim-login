＃198화



집무실 내부에는 어색한 기류가 흘렀다.

진위경은 진위경대로, 적천강은 적천강대로 서로의 눈치를 보며 차와 술을 홀짝였다.

‘적 대협께서 직접 찾아오시다니. 무슨 일이지?’

‘귀신에 홀린 건가. 하필이면 여길 오다니.’

하지만 침묵에도 한계가 있는 법.

연거푸 술잔을 비워 낸 적천강이 입을 열었다. 기왕 이렇게 된 거, 진태경에 관한 의문이나 속 시원히 풀고 갈 생각이었다.

“그 녀석을 만나고 오는 길이었네.”

“아, 태경이 말씀이시군요.”

재깍 알아들은 진위경이 조심스럽게 눈치를 살폈다.

이미 사정은 모두 들어서 알고 있다. 죽은 제자에 관한 마음의 빚 때문에 태원진가를 도와줬다는 것을.

다만 이틀 전에 있었던 비급 훼손 사건의 울분이 아직 안 풀렸나 싶어 걱정되었다.

“혹시 비급 때문이십니까?”

“그건 이미 기억에서 지웠네. 비급이 아무리 귀하다지만 사람이 제일 아니겠나. 안 그래?”

“…….”

“뭔가, 그 표정은?”

“아, 아무것도 아닙니다.”

그렇게 죽사발을 내 놓고 이제 와서 사람 운운하다니.

진위경은 혀끝에서 맴도는 말을 꿀꺽 삼켰다.

“여하간 노부가 좀 심하게 때린 것 같아 벌모세수로 몸이나 만져 주려고 찾아갔지.”

“버, 벌모세수요? 제가 아는 그 벌모세수가 맞습니까?”

눈을 부릅뜬 진위경에게 적천강이 고개를 끄덕였다.

“그럼 다른 벌모세수도 있나?”

“아, 아닙니다. 너무 놀라서 그만.”

“놀라?”

“적 대협처럼 대단하신 분께서 제 아우에게 벌모세수를 해 주셨다고 하니 어찌 놀라지 않을 수 있겠습니까? 이는 본가의 큰 흥복입니다.”

기뻐하는 진위경의 모습을 물끄러미 바라보던 적천강은 한 가지 사실을 깨달았다.

“그렇군. 자네는 모를 수도 있겠어.”

“예?”

아는 만큼 보이는 법. 천하에서 손꼽히는 초절정 고수인 적천강도 진태경의 근골이 설마 그 정도일 거라고는 미처 생각하지 못했다. 그러니 진위경은 오죽하겠는가.

‘이제라도 알게 된 것이 다행인가?’

작게 혀를 찬 적천강이 입을 열었다.

“벌모세수의 효과는 미비하네.”

“그게 무슨 말씀이십니까? 벌모세수가 효과가 없다니요?”

“그 말이 아닐세. 진태경, 그 녀석에게는 벌모세수가 필요 없다고 해야 맞겠군. 아직 속단하기는 이르지만…….”

적천강이 나직하게 한마디를 덧붙였다.

“아마 천무지체(天武肢體)가 아닐까 싶네.”

“……!”

짧은 순간, 진위경의 얼굴 위로 경악의 빛이 스쳤다.

그러나 이내 담담하게 고개를 끄덕이는 그의 모습에 적천강이 물었다.

“알고 있었나?”

“몰랐습니다. 다만 이제야 납득했을 뿐입니다.”

“납득이라, 무엇을?”

“불가사의할 정도로 빠른 태경이의 무공 성취에 대해서입니다. 하지만 천무지체라면 충분히 설명 가능하지요. 바로 그 천무지체라면 말입니다.”

“불가사의할 정도로 빠르다고?”

미간을 좁힌 적천강이 말을 이었다.

“그 녀석이 또래에 비해 매우 뛰어난 성취를 거두긴 했지만 그 정도는 아닐세. 아니, 오히려 천무지체의 전설을 생각하면 부족하게 느껴질 정도야.”

그의 목소리에는 확신이 담겨 있었다.

그도 그럴 것이, 석년의 적천강도 진태경에 비해 더하면 더했지 덜하진 않았기 때문이다.

당금 무림을 주름잡는 초절정 고수들은 어릴 때부터 천재적인 두각을 드러냈고, 그들과 비교하자면 현재 진태경의 경지는 평범한 수준이었다.

“천무지체는 말 그대로 하늘이 내린 근골일세. 수백 년, 혹은 천 년에 한 번 하늘의 변덕으로 한낱 인간의 몸에 신이 깃든 것이지. 하지만 지금의 녀석은…….”

“절정 초입이지요.”

“그렇지. 하지만 천하는 넓고 인재는 많은 법일세. 당장 청풍, 그 아이만 봐도 알 수 있지.”

적천강의 말은 전부 사실이었다.

구파일방과 오대세가의 품에 안긴 자들이 전부가 아니다.

아직 중원에까지 이름이 알려지지 않은 젊은 인재와 초야(草野)에 파묻혀 무공을 수련하고 있는 이도 있을 것이다.

당장 천하를 밑바닥부터 박박 긁어 보면 일신, 삼성, 십왕에 육박하는 초절정 고수도 여럿 나올 터.

“노부가 확신하지 못하는 이유도 그것일세. 분명 뛰어나지만…… 이 정도로는 부족해. 전설은 전설일 뿐인가? 어쩌면 근골에 비해 무재(武才)가 떨어지는 것일지도 모르겠군.”

“재미있군요.”

“뭐가 말인가?”

“저는 그 반대라고 생각했으니 말입니다.”

의문 어린 표정의 적천강을 향해 진위경이 빙긋 웃었다.

“제 아우의 무재는 천하제일입니다. 아니, 고금제일이라고 해도 무방합니다.”

“뭐, 뭐라?”

적천강은 욕이 튀어나오려는 것을 간신히 참았다.

살아 있는 전설이나 다름없는 그조차도 감히 천하제일이라는 말은 입에 담지 못한다. 하물며 고금제일이라니?

하지만 진위경에게서 느껴지는 자신감과 확신이 적천강으로 하여금 질문을 던지게 만들었다.

“그렇게 생각한 근거가 무엇인가?”

진위경은 조용히 세 손가락을 폈다.

“석 달.”

“……?”

“태경이가 무공을 익힌 기간입니다.”

“……!”

“기루나 들락거리던 삼류 한량이 절정 고수가 되기까지 걸린 시간이기도 하지요.”

순간 적천강의 눈앞이 새하얗게 물들었다. 머릿속에서는 번개가 치고 심장이 거세게 뛰었다.

삼류에서 절정까지 고작 석 달이라니. 말도 안 된다. 결단코 불가능하다.

하지만…….

‘가능하다. 천무지체라면.’

적천강은 초절정 고수다.

그러나 단신으로 천 명을 죽일 만큼 강대한 그조차도 세월의 힘에 스러져 가는 노인에 불과했다.

반면 천무지체는 하늘의 선택과 변덕으로 탄생한 존재.

한낱 인간이 어찌 하늘의 뜻을 짐작하랴.

‘이것이 천외(天外)라는 것인가?’

적천강은 천천히 자리에서 일어나 창가로 다가갔다. 굳게 닫힌 창문을 열자 끝없이 펼쳐진 푸른 하늘이 보였다.

몰려드는 찬바람을 맞으며 그는 문득 생각했다.

하늘은 왜 진태경을 선택했을까, 그리고 어째서 그와 자신을 만나게 했을까.

‘당신은 누구요? 거기 누가 있긴 한 거요?’

대답은 들려오지 않았다.

고요하고 청명한 하늘 위, 떠다니는 조각구름을 한참이나 말없이 응시하던 적천강이 입을 열었다.

“술이 더 필요할 것 같군. 자네 생각은 어떤가?”

진태경이 웃으며 대답했다.

“잘됐군요. 마침 저도 차가 질리던 참이었습니다.”



* * *



다음 날, 혁무진이 찾아와 뜻밖의 말을 전했다.

“연회에 참석하시라는데요?”

“나?”

“그럼 누구겠습니까.”

나는 생각할 것도 없이 대답했다.

“싫은데.”

한 자리 차지하고 앉아 있어 봤자 좀이 쑤실 뿐이다.

사람들은 동물원 원숭이 보듯이 나를 구경할 테고 극성 팬인 상산왕한테 사인이나 해 주겠지.

차라리 전각에 콕 틀어박혀 운기조식이나 무공에 대한 고민을 하는 게 백배 낫다.

“그냥 못 간다고 전해.”

“소가주님 지시입니다만.”

“그럼 더 잘됐네. 형은 별말 안 할걸? 솔직히 폐관 수련이 겨우 사흘 만에 끝났다는 것도 사람들이 볼 때 이상하잖아.”

“그냥 적당히 약간의 깨달음을 얻었다 하면 되죠. 본인이 그렇다는데 누가 뭐라 하겠습니까?”

“…….”

그것도 그러네.

나는 점점 논리적으로 되어 가는 혁무진을 보며 눈을 게슴츠레 떴다.

“나 아직 환자야.”

“다 나으시지 않았습니까. 아침에 보니 멍도 거의 다 빠지셨던데.”

사실 혁무진의 말처럼 상반신에 가득하던 멍 자국들은 대부분 사라진 후였다.

이런 걸 보면 확실히 벌모세수의 효과가 있긴 한 모양이다.

물론 내 입장에서는 스탯이 더 오르는 게 훨씬 도움이 되었겠지만.

혁무진이 골치 아프다는 듯이 뒤통수를 긁적였다.

“그냥 가시죠?”

“아직 아프다고 해. 내가 아프다는데 누가 뭐라 하겠냐.”

“적 대협이요.”

“응?”

“적 대협이 지금쯤이면 다 나았을 테니까 개수작 부릴 생각하지 말랍니다. 아니면 직접 오셔서 끌고 가시겠다고…….”

“젠장. 그 노인네도 아직 연회장이야?”

“소가주님과 밤을 새워 대작(對酌)하시더니 방금 전에 만취한 상태로 나타나셨습니다.”

나는 한숨을 푹 내쉬었다.

이번 회합이 끝날 때까지만 태원진가에 머무르겠다던 적천강이었다.

원래 일정대로라면 어제 떠났어야 했지만, 사람들이 모이고 거물들의 등장으로 회합이 연장되면서 자연스럽게 그가 머무는 기간도 늘어났다.

“시바, 그래 가자. 가.”

“잘 생각하셨습니다. 안 가면 제가 죽을 판이었거든요.”

나는 헤헤 웃는 혁무진을 따라 연회장으로 향했다.

여전히 시장통 저리 가라 할 정도로 인산인해였지만 그나마 인원 통제를 하기 시작했는지 첫날보다는 훨씬 줄어든 숫자였다.

“날이 갈수록 사람이 몰리는 바람에 어쩔 수 없었습니다. 그 많은 사람이 온종일 먹고 마시는데, 소모되는 재물은 둘째 치고 자리가 없더라고요.”

“좀 더 쳐 내지 그랬냐. 아직 한참 많아 보이는데.”

“더 쳐 내면 욕먹습니다. 지금 남아 있는 자들은 아무리 못해도 작은 무관(武館)의 관주 정도는 되는지라.”

“자존심은 세워 준다?”

“뭐, 그런 거죠. 첫날에 있던 사람들도 내보내면서 선물 하나씩은 쥐여 줬습니다.”

풀뿌리 민심까지 관리한다는 건가.

이 모든 것을 염두에 둔 계산이든, 순수한 인간적인 호의건 간에 확실히 진위경은 수완이 좋다.

자존심과 무공을 앞세우는 여타의 무인과는 다른, 관료형 무인이라고 하나?

아마 진위경이라는 훌륭한 CEO가 없었다면 태원진가도 지금의 위치에 오르기는 힘들었을 것이다.

“어어, 우리 막내! 사랑하는 내 아우 왔느냐!”

“…….”

그래, 이런 것만 빼면 완벽하지.

술을 얼마나 마셨는지 얼굴이 시뻘겋다. 상석에서 고래고래 소리를 지르는 진위경의 모습에 곳곳에서 웃음이 터졌다.

‘아주 작정하고 마셨네. 작정했어.’

진위경도 명색이 절정 고수다. 공력으로 취기를 몰아낼 수 있음에도 이 정도로 취했다는 건 애초에 그럴 생각이 없었다는 뜻.

옆자리에 앉은 적천강도 상태는 비슷했다.

“부른 지가 언젠데 이제야 오는 게냐?”

“……바로 온 건데요.”

내 대답에 적천강이 코웃음 쳤다.

“바로 오긴 쥐뿔이. 안 간다고 밍기적대다가 노부가 있다는 말을 듣고 부리나케 왔겠지.”

“…….”

“네놈이 뛰어 봐야 이 손바닥 안이니라. 되지도 않는 소리 하지 말고 앉아라.”

역시 귀신 같은 노인네.

나는 백무성과 이소월을 포함한 낯익은 얼굴들과 눈인사를 나누며 슬금슬금 걸음을 옮겼다.

적천강의 옆자리에 앉자마자 밥그릇만 한 술잔이 불쑥 튀어나온다.

“한 잔 마셔라.”

“아, 예.”

한 사발을 가득 채워 쭉 들이켰다. 소매로 입가를 훔치는 내게 적천강이 다시 술병을 들이밀었다.

“한 잔 더.”

“예.”

또 다시 원샷.

“더.”

“……또요?”

“뭐라 했느냐?”

“아뇨. 술 맛이 너무 좋아서 그만.”

이거 어째 느낌이 쎄 한데.

결국 일 다경도 안 돼서 혼자 술동이 하나를 비웠다. 그제야 만족스럽다는 듯이 입꼬리를 끌어올리는 적천강이다.

“그래, 이 정도는 마셔야지.”

“…….”

언젠가 인터넷에서 본 대학교 신입생 환영회 썰이 생각나는 건 왜일까.

차이점이 있다면 억지로 술 먹이는 사람이 화석 학번 선배가 아니라 화왕이라는 거지.

‘시작부터 빡세네.’

어쨌건 한고비 넘겼군.

잔뜩 만취한 적천강이 소피를 보러 간 틈을 타 한숨 돌리고 있던 그때였다.

“내가 한 잔 따라 줘도 되겠나?”

갑자기 말을 건넨 것은 단단한 체구의 중년인이었다.

강직한 눈빛과 꾹 다문 입술. 알 수 없는 표정으로 나를 바라보던 그가 말을 이었다.

“산동악가(山東岳家)의 악불군이라고 하네.”

산동악가? 소설에서도, 무림에 와서도 몇 번인가 들어 본 이름이다.

나는 엉거주춤 고개를 숙였다.

“아, 저는.”

“이미 알고 있네. 산서잠룡 진태경. 작년에 생도들에게 들었을 때만 해도 그런 별호는 아니었지만.”

“……생도요?”

생도라니, 이 양반 지금 무슨 소리를 하는 거지?

어리둥절한 나를 보며 악불군이 희미하게 웃었다.

“천무학관이라고 들어봤나? 나는 그곳에서 창술 교관을 맡고 있지.”

“아.”

“아는지 모르겠지만 자네 둘째 형이 학관 내에서는 제법 유명한 편일세. 그렇다 보니 자연스럽게 자네에 관한 이야기도 흘러나오더군.”

나는 피식 웃었다.

석 달 전까지만 해도 가문의 수치라 불리던 몸이니 어떤 이야기였을지는 안 들어 봐도 뻔하다.

“좋은 이야기는 아니었겠군요.”

“강호의 소문은 믿을 게 못 된다네. 자네만 봐도 알 수 있는 사실이지.”

“글쎄요.”

나는 애매하게 대답하며 그가 따라 주는 술을 마셨다.

“그런데 여기는 어쩐 일로 오셨습니까?”

“잠시 볼일을 보러왔는데 학관에서 연락이 왔네. 잠깐 가문에 다녀온다던 생도 하나가 묵묵부답이니 데려오라고.”

“진무경, 아니 제 둘째 형님이군요.”

“맞네. 폐관수련 중이라지?”

내가 고개를 끄덕이자 악불군이 턱수염을 쓸었다.

“곤란하군. 아무리 늦어도 칠 주야 안에는 출발해야 할 터인데. 혹시 폐관에 들어가며 아무런 언질도 없었나?”

“예. 본인이 만족해야 끝낼 성격이라.”

“익히 알고 있네. 직접 가르친 적도 있으니.”

작게 한숨을 내쉰 그가 불쑥 입을 열었다.

“하면 자네는 어떤가?”

“예?”

“이참에 천무학관의 생도가 되는 것 말일세. 아, 혹시 화왕께 사사한다는 소문이 사실이라면 못 들은 셈 치고.”

느닷없이 천무학관이라니. 이건 예상하지 못했는데.

천무학관은 등용문이나 다름없는 곳이다. 자질을 인정받은 천하의 인재들, 뛰어난 교관들과 수많은 기회가 도사린 곳.

특정 조건을 만족한다면 진무경처럼 상승의 무공을 익힐 수도 있다고 들었다.

‘지금처럼 태원진가에 머무른다면 성장에 한계가 있다.’

이번 노호검객의 일로 깨달았다. 무언가를 얻어도 지킬 힘이 없다면 당할 수밖에 없다는 사실을.

지금보다 더 강해지기 위해서는 전환점이 필요했고, 천무학관은 안전과 가능성이 보장된 곳이다.

‘내가 정말 화왕의 제자라면 모를까. 지금으로서는 가장 좋은 선택지인 것은 맞다.’

쉽게 대답하지 못하는 내게 악불군이 말했다.

“입관 시기는 지났지만 특별 허가를 내려 줄 수 있네.”

“특별 허가요?”

“자네는 뛰어난 인재니까.”

악불군의 거친 손바닥이 내 어깨를 짚었다.

“어떤가? 천무학관의 생도가 되는 것이. 자네라면 상부도 두 팔 벌려 환영할 걸세.”

“저는…….”

내가 막 입을 뗀 그때였다.

“손 떼.”

“……!”

화악!

뜨거운 열기와 함께 순간 눈앞이 아찔해질 정도의 주독(酒毒)이 뿜어져 나온다.

이어지는 적천강의 목소리에는 일말의 취기도 묻어 있지 않았다.

“내 거에서 손 떼라고.”

# Chapter 198

An awkward atmosphere hung inside the office.

Jin Wikyung and Jeok Cheongang each stole glances at the other while sipping tea and liquor.

*Great Hero Jeok came here in person. What could this be about?*

*Has he been possessed by a ghost? Of all places, why did he have to come here?*

But even silence had its limits.

After emptying several more cups, Jeok Cheongang finally spoke. Since things had turned out this way, he intended to clear up some questions about Jin Taekyung before he left.

“I was on my way back from seeing that fellow.”

“Ah, you mean Taekyung.”

Jin Wikyung understood immediately and carefully gauged his mood.

He had already heard the whole story. Jeok Cheongang had helped the Jin Family of Taiyuan because of the emotional debt he carried toward his dead Disciple.

But he was worried that the anger caused by the martial arts manual incident two days ago might not have faded yet.

“Is this perhaps about the martial arts manual?”

“This old man has already erased that from his memory. No matter how precious a manual is, people are more important, aren’t they?”

“…”

“What is it? What’s with that expression?”

“Oh, it’s nothing.”

*After beating him into a pulp, he’s talking about how people are more important now?*

Jin Wikyung swallowed the words hovering at the tip of his tongue.

“In any event, I thought I might have hit him a little too hard, so I went to treat his body by cleansing the sinews and washing the marrow.”

“C-Cleansing the sinews and washing the marrow? You mean the cleansing I know about?”

Jeok Cheongang nodded at Jin Wikyung’s wide-eyed stare.

“Is there another kind?”

“No, of course not. I was just so surprised.”

“Surprised?”

“How could I not be surprised to hear that someone as extraordinary as Great Hero Jeok performed cleansing the sinews and washing the marrow on my younger brother? This is a great blessing for our family.”

Jeok Cheongang gazed at Jin Wikyung’s delighted face and realized something.

“I see. You might not have known.”

“Pardon?”

You can only see as much as you know. Even Jeok Cheongang, one of the most renowned Supreme Peak masters in the world, had never imagined that Jin Taekyung’s bones and muscles could be that exceptional.

So how could Jin Wikyung have known?

*Perhaps it was fortunate that I found out now.*

Jeok Cheongang clicked his tongue softly before speaking.

“The effect of cleansing the sinews and washing the marrow was minimal.”

“What are you saying? How could cleansing the sinews and washing the marrow have no effect?”

“That isn’t what I mean. It would be more accurate to say that Jin Taekyung doesn’t need it. It’s too early to make a definite judgment, but…”

Jeok Cheongang added in a low voice:

“I think he might possess the Heavenly Martial Physique.”

“!”

For a brief moment, shock flashed across Jin Wikyung’s face.

But then he calmly nodded, prompting Jeok Cheongang to ask:

“You already knew?”

“I didn’t. I only understand it now.”

“Understand what?”

“Taekyung’s astonishingly rapid progress in martial arts. But if he possesses the Heavenly Martial Physique, it can be explained. If it really is that Heavenly Martial Physique.”

“Astonishingly rapid?”

Jeok Cheongang narrowed his brow and continued.

“That fellow has certainly achieved remarkable results for someone his age, but not to that extent. No, when you consider the legends surrounding the Heavenly Martial Physique, his progress actually feels insufficient.”

His voice held absolute certainty.

And for good reason. When Jeok Cheongang had been young, he had been no less talented than Jin Taekyung. If anything, he had been more so.

The Supreme Peak masters who currently dominated the Murim had shown flashes of genius from childhood. Compared to them, Jin Taekyung’s current realm was merely ordinary.

“The Heavenly Martial Physique is exactly what its name says: bones and muscles granted by Heaven. Once every several hundred years—or perhaps once every thousand years—a whim of Heaven causes a god to dwell within the body of a mere human. But the boy now…”

“He’s only at the beginning of the Peak realm.”

“Exactly. But the world is vast, and there are many talented people. Cheongpung alone proves that.”

Everything Jeok Cheongang said was true.

The people sheltered by the Nine Sects and One Gang and the Five Great Families were not the only ones who existed.

There were undoubtedly young talents whose names had not yet reached the Central Plains, as well as people who had buried themselves in the countryside while training in martial arts.

If one scoured the entire world from the very bottom, several Supreme Peak masters approaching the level of the One God, the Three Saints, and the Ten Kings would surely emerge.

“That is why this old man cannot be certain. The boy is certainly exceptional, but… it isn’t enough. Is a legend merely a legend? Perhaps his martial talent is inferior to his physique.”

“How interesting.”

“What is?”

“I thought the opposite.”

Jin Wikyung smiled faintly at Jeok Cheongang’s questioning expression.

“My younger brother’s martial talent is the greatest beneath Heaven. No, you could call it the greatest in all history.”

“W-What did you say?”

Jeok Cheongang barely managed to suppress the curse that nearly escaped his mouth.

Even he, a living legend in all but name, did not dare claim to be the greatest beneath Heaven. And this man was calling his younger brother the greatest in all history?

Yet the confidence and conviction radiating from Jin Wikyung made Jeok Cheongang ask another question.

“What grounds do you have for thinking that?”

Jin Wikyung quietly extended three fingers.

“Three months.”

“…”

“That’s how long Taekyung has been learning martial arts.”

“!”

“It’s also how long it took a Third Rate wastrel who frequented pleasure houses to become a Peak master.”

For an instant, Jeok Cheongang’s vision turned white. Lightning crackled inside his head, and his heart pounded violently.

Three months from Third Rate to Peak. It was absurd. Categorically impossible.

But…

*It’s possible. If he possesses the Heavenly Martial Physique.*

Jeok Cheongang was a Supreme Peak master.

Yet even he—powerful enough to kill a thousand people alone—was merely an old man whose body was withering beneath the force of time.

The Heavenly Martial Physique, on the other hand, was an existence born from Heaven’s choice and whim.

*How could a mere human presume to guess Heaven’s intentions?*

*Is this what lies beyond Heaven?*

Jeok Cheongang slowly rose from his seat and approached the window. When he opened the tightly closed window, he saw an endless blue sky.

As the cold wind rushed inside, he suddenly wondered:

Why had Heaven chosen Jin Taekyung? And why had it caused Taekyung and him to meet?

*Who are you? Is there really someone there?*

No answer came.

Jeok Cheongang stared silently at the drifting scraps of cloud in the clear, tranquil sky for a long while before speaking.

“I think we need more liquor. What do you say?”

Jin Taekyung answered with a smile.

“Great. I was getting sick of tea anyway.”

* * *

The next day, Hyuk Mujin came to deliver some unexpected news.

“They want you to attend the banquet.”

“Me?”

“Who else would they mean?”

I answered without a moment’s hesitation.

“I don’t want to.”

Even if I sat there occupying a seat, I would only grow restless.

People would gawk at me like I was a monkey in a zoo, and my biggest fan, Prince Shangshan, would probably ask me for another autograph.

I’d much rather hole myself up in a pavilion and circulate my qi or ponder martial arts. It would be a hundred times better.

“Just tell them I can’t go.”

“It was the Lesser Family Head’s order.”

“Then that makes things even better. My brother won’t say anything, will he? Besides, people would find it strange if my closed-door training ended after only three days.”

“Just say you gained a little insight. If you say that’s what happened, who’s going to argue?”

“…”

He had a point.

I narrowed my eyes as I watched Hyuk Mujin become more and more logical.

“I’m still a patient.”

“You’ve already recovered. When I saw you this morning, almost all your bruises were gone.”

Just as Hyuk Mujin said, most of the bruises that had covered my upper body had already disappeared.

Seeing that, I supposed cleansing the sinews and washing the marrow really did have some effect.

Of course, from my perspective, gaining more stats would have been far more helpful.

Hyuk Mujin scratched the back of his head as though he had a headache.

“Why don’t you just go?”

“Tell them I’m still in pain. Who’s going to complain if I say I am?”

“Great Hero Jeok.”

“Huh?”

“He says that you should stop trying any tricks because you’ll have recovered by now. Otherwise, he’ll come here himself and drag you away.”

“Damn it. That old man is still at the banquet hall?”

“He drank through the night with the Lesser Family Head and appeared just a moment ago, completely drunk.”

I let out a deep sigh.

Jeok Cheongang had said he would remain at the Jin Family of Taiyuan only until this gathering ended.

According to the original schedule, he should have left yesterday. But the gathering had been extended as more people arrived and heavyweights began appearing, so his stay had naturally been extended as well.

“Shit. Fine, let’s go. Let’s go.”

“Good thinking. If you hadn’t, I would’ve been a dead man.”

I followed Hyuk Mujin, who was grinning foolishly, toward the banquet hall.

It was still packed tighter than a marketplace, but perhaps because they had finally begun controlling the crowds, there were far fewer people than on the first day.

“We had no choice. More and more people kept arriving every day. So many people were eating and drinking all day that, leaving aside the expense, we ran out of room.”

“You should’ve turned more of them away. It still looks like there are a lot of people.”

“If we turn away any more, people will curse us. The ones who remain are, at the very least, heads of small martial arts academies.”

“So you’re making sure their pride stays intact?”

“Something like that. We even gave each person a gift when we sent away the people who had been here on the first day.”

*They’re managing even the grassroots sentiment?*

Whether it was the result of careful calculations that had taken all this into account or simple human kindness, Jin Wikyung was undeniably capable.

He was different from the other martial artists who put their pride and martial arts first. Could he be what you would call a bureaucrat-style martial artist?

If the excellent CEO Jin Wikyung did not exist, the Jin Family of Taiyuan probably would not have risen to its current position.

“Hey, our youngest! My beloved little brother, you’ve come!”

“…”

Yes, he would have been perfect if not for things like this.

His face was bright red from all the liquor he had consumed. Jin Wikyung bellowed from the seat of honor, and laughter erupted from every corner of the hall.

*He really went all out. He really did.*

Jin Wikyung was a Peak master, after all. He could have driven away the drunkenness with internal energy, so the fact that he was this drunk meant he had never intended to do so.

Jeok Cheongang, seated beside him, was in a similar state.

“I called you ages ago. Why are you only coming now?”

“…I came right away.”

“I’d hardly call this coming right away. You dragged your feet after saying you wouldn’t come, then came running as soon as you heard this old man was here.”

“…”

“No matter how far you run, you’re still in the palm of my hand. Stop spouting nonsense and sit down.”

As expected of that terrifyingly perceptive old man.

I exchanged nods with several familiar faces, including Baek Museong and Lee Seowol, then cautiously made my way forward.

The instant I sat beside Jeok Cheongang, a bowl-sized liquor cup suddenly appeared in front of me.

“Drink.”

“Oh. Yes.”

I filled the cup to the brim and downed it in one gulp. As I wiped my mouth with my sleeve, Jeok Cheongang thrust the liquor bottle toward me again.

“One more.”

“Yes.”

Another one-shot.

“More.”

“…Again?”

“What did you say?”

“No. The liquor just tastes so good, that’s all.”

*Something about this feels off.*

In the end, I emptied an entire liquor jar by myself before even a quarter of an hour had passed. Only then did Jeok Cheongang pull up the corners of his mouth in satisfaction.

“That’s more like it. You need to drink at least this much.”

“…”

Why was I suddenly thinking of a story I had once seen online about a university freshman welcome party?

The difference was that the person forcing me to drink wasn’t some senior from a fossilized class year.

It was the Fire King.

*This is brutal right from the start.*

Still, I had made it past one hurdle.

I was catching my breath while Jeok Cheongang, thoroughly drunk, went to relieve himself when someone suddenly spoke to me.

“May I pour you a drink?”

The person who had addressed me was a solidly built, middle-aged man.

He had stern eyes and tightly pressed lips. He looked at me with an unreadable expression before continuing:

“I’m Ak Bulgun of the Shandong Yue Family.”

The Shandong Yue Family? I had heard that name several times, both in novels and after coming to the Murim.

I gave him an awkward bow.

“Ah, I’m—”

“I already know. Jin Taekyung, the Sleeping Dragon of Shanxi. Though when I heard about you from the cadets last year, you didn’t have that nickname yet.”

“…Cadets?”

What was this man talking about?

Seeing my bewilderment, Ak Bulgun smiled faintly.

“Have you heard of Heaven’s Gate Temple? I serve as a spear Instructor there.”

“Oh.”

“I don’t know if you’re aware, but your second brother is fairly famous within the academy. Naturally, stories about you have made their way to us as well.”

I let out a quiet laugh.

Until three months ago, I had been called the disgrace of my family. I didn’t need to hear the stories to know exactly what they had been.

“They probably weren’t very flattering.”

“Rumors in the martial world aren’t worth believing. You yourself are proof of that.”

“Who knows?”

I answered vaguely and drank the liquor he poured for me.

“But what brings you here?”

“I came to take care of some business, but then I received a message from the academy. A cadet who said he was going to visit his family for a short while has stopped responding, so they told me to bring him back.”

“Jin Mukyung—I mean, my second brother.”

“That’s right. I hear he’s in closed-door training?”

When I nodded, Ak Bulgun stroked his beard.

“That’s troublesome. He’ll have to leave within seven days at the latest, no matter what. Did he give you any indication before entering seclusion?”

“No. He’s the sort of person who won’t stop until he’s satisfied with his progress.”

“I know. I’ve taught him myself.”

He let out a small sigh before suddenly speaking again.

“What about you?”

“Me?”

“Why not become a cadet at Heaven’s Gate Temple while you’re at it? Ah, if the rumor that you’re studying under the Fire King is true, pretend you never heard me.”

Heaven’s Gate Temple, out of nowhere. I hadn’t expected this.

Heaven’s Gate Temple was practically a gateway to advancement—a place filled with the finest talents in the world whose abilities had been recognized, excellent Instructors, and countless opportunities.

I had heard that, if you met certain conditions, you could even learn advanced martial arts like Jin Mukyung.

*If I stay at the Jin Family of Taiyuan as I am now, my growth will eventually hit a ceiling.*

The Roaring Fury Swordsman’s incident had taught me that much. Even if you obtained something, you would have no choice but to suffer if you lacked the strength to protect it.

I needed a turning point if I wanted to become stronger than I was now, and Heaven’s Gate Temple was a place where both safety and opportunity were guaranteed.

*Unless I’m really the Fire King’s Disciple, this is definitely the best option available to me right now.*

When I failed to answer immediately, Ak Bulgun spoke.

“The admission period has already passed, but I can grant you special permission.”

“Special permission?”

“You’re an exceptional talent.”

Ak Bulgun’s rough palm came to rest on my shoulder.

“What do you say? Become a cadet at Heaven’s Gate Temple. If it’s you, the higher-ups will welcome you with open arms.”

“I…”

Just as I opened my mouth, a voice cut through the air.

“Take your hand off.”

“!”

Along with a burst of scorching heat came alcohol fumes so overpowering that my vision swam.

And there was not a trace of drunkenness in Jeok Cheongang’s voice.

“I said take your hand off what’s mine.”
