스킬창



[비급 제작]

등급 : 無

제한 : 대성을 이룬 무공

설명 : 시전자가 대성을 이룬 무공에 한하여 비급을 제작할 수 있다. 무공에 대한 이해도가 깊다면 더 좋은 결과가 나올지도?

특이사항 : 비급을 제작하기 위한 재료가 필요함.





스킬 정보창을 보며 생각했다.

가만있자, 이걸 언제 받았더라?

‘진가보법을 대성했을 때였나? 아니면 진가창법?’

일 년도 넘은지라 기억이 가물가물하다.

어쩌다 보니 스킬을 받긴 했는데, 막상 쓸 곳이 없어서 단 한 번도 사용해 본 적이 없었기 때문이다.

‘아니지, 정확히 말하면 쓸 곳이 없었던 게 아니라 쓸 생각이 없었던 거지.’

현대에 돌아와 평화 길드원들을 마주할 때마다 간혹 그런 충동이 들기는 했었다. 그러나 매번 내리는 최종 결론은 ‘아니다’ 였다.

‘무공을 유출시켰다가 무슨 곤욕을 치르려고.’

누구는 청동기로 싸우는데, 어떤 놈이 강철 검을 들고 와 닥치는 대로 썰어 버린다고 생각해 봐라.

누구나 그를 부러워할 것이고 강철 검을 차지하기 위해 개떼처럼 모여들 것이다.

평화 길드원들을 못 믿는 건 아니지만, 적어도 그 당시에는 옳은 판단이었다고 생각한다.

‘하지만 이제는 망설일 이유가 없지.’

이정룡과 그 휘하에 있는 박지훈, 석고준과 직접 손을 섞으며 깨달았다. 현대에도 내가 알지 못하는 비밀이 있다는 것을.

놈들의 움직임과 마나의 운용은 분명 무림인에 가까운 그것이었다. 적이 강철 검으로 무장했다면 우리도 비슷한 장비를 갖춰야 한다.

“후우…….”

크게 숨을 들이마시자 구린내가 콧속으로 빨려 들어온다.

지금 내가 쪼그려 앉아 있는 곳은 화장실 칸막이다.

환경은 최악이지만 사람 눈에 띄지 않고 무공 비급을 제작하기에는 적격이었다.

‘그럼 어디 한번 시작해 볼까.’

병원 내부 편의점에서 사 온 A4 용지와 펜을 촤르륵 펼쳤다.

그리고 마음속으로 중얼거렸다.

‘비급 제작 스킬 발동.’

띠링.



- 모든 재료가 완비되었습니다.

- [비급 제작] 스킬이 활성화됩니다. 대성(大成)을 이룬 무공을 비급으로 제작할 수 있습니다.

- 현재 제작 가능한 목록 : 진가심법, 진가보법, 진가창법.

- 원하는 무공을 선택하십시오.



현재 내가 익힌 열화문의 무공 중 대성을 이룬 것은 존재하지 않는다.

반면 태원 진가의 가전 무공은 안정적이고, 무공이 가진 위력도 적당하다.

나는 그중에서도 가장 근간이 되는 한 가지를 골랐다.

‘진가심법 선택.’

띠링.



[진가심법]을 비급으로 제작하시겠습니까?

Y / N



‘예스.’

삐빅! 삐빅!



- 지능이 부족합니다! 능지가 부족합니다!

- 가르치는 것은 익히는 것보다 몇 배는 어려운 법!

- [절정] 등급의 무공을 비급으로 제작하기 위해서는 최소 100의 지력이 필요합니다!



“……아, 개새끼들. 진짜.”

나는 피눈물을 흘리며 상태창을 열었다.

피 같은 포인트를 지력에 투자하자, 펜을 쥔 손이 저절로 A4 용지 위를 전광석화처럼 누볐다.

촤촤촤촤촥!

“헉!”

두 번 놀랐다.

그 엄청난 속도에 한 번, 그리고 쓰이는 모든 언어가 중국어라는 것에 두 번.

“…….”

씨벌, 못 해 먹겠네.

나는 언어 설정을 찾아 헤매기 시작했다.



* * *



드르륵.

평화 길드원들이 있는 병실로 들어섰다. 옹기종기 모여서 이야기를 나누고 있던 사람들이 나를 향해 고개를 돌린다.

“어디 갔다 오길래 이렇게 늦…… 혹시 화장실 다녀왔어?”

코를 움켜쥔 송송이의 말에 나는 음울하게 대답했다.

“어떻게 알았냐.”

“똥 냄새가 진동하길래.”

“심해?”

“응. 사람이 아니라 거대한 똥이 걸어오는 줄 알았어.”

“덕담 고맙다. 기운이 나네.”

냄새나는 화장실 칸막이에서 한 시간을 넘게 있다 보니 코가 마비됐다.

나는 기운이 쪽 빠진 목소리로 대답하며 스테이플러로 찍은 A4 용지 묶음을 건넸다.

“여기.”

“이게 뭔데?”

“널 위한 러브레터. 설사하면서 썼다.”

“우웩, 우웨에엑!”

“리액션 풍부한 것 보소.”

“우웨에에엑!”

“…….”

리액션이 아니라 리얼이었네.

이미 볼 장 다 봤다고 생각했지만, 마음 한구석이 아려 오는 건 어쩔 수 없다.

“사랑했다…….”

“우웨에에에엑!”

“송송이 헌터님. 괜찮으십니까?”

거세지는 헛구역질에 가장 가까이에 있던 김 집사가 나는 듯이 달려와 등을 두드려 주었다.

그사이 송송이가 태극기처럼 휘두르던 A4 용지는 한 사람의 손에 넘어갔다.

첫 면에 적힌 글자를 읽은 최 팀장이 나를 보며 피식 웃는다.

“진가심법? 러브레터치고는 제목이 특이한데요.”

“안에 적힌 내용은 더 특이할 겁니다.”

“……네?”

“계속 읽어 보세요.”

최 팀장은 눈치가 빨랐다. 그는 즉시 자세를 바로 하고 신중한 얼굴로 페이지를 넘겼다.

직접 썼다고는 믿기지 않을 만큼 기계 같은 필체 위를 한 쌍의 눈동자가 바쁘게 굴러다녔다.

팔락. 팔락. 팔락…….

속도는 점점 더 빨라졌고 최 팀장의 입술 사이로 더운 숨이 뿜어져 나왔다.

순식간에 10여 페이지를 독파한 그가 고개를 번쩍 쳐들었다. 나를 보는 눈동자는 쟁반처럼 부풀어 있었다.

“이건……!”

그 반응에 나도 적잖이 놀랐다.

‘이게 뭔지 알고 있다고?’

말이 무공 비급이지, 막상 제작하고 보니 진가심법의 비급은 모르는 사람이 보면 한의학 서적으로 착각할 정도였다.

인체에 존재하는 수많은 혈도의 위치와 그 기능, 공력을 운용하는 경로까지 표시되어 있으니까.

송송이였다면 몇 장 보고 덮었을 테지만, 최 팀장의 반응은 생각했던 것 이상이었다.

“뭔지 알아보겠습니까?”

“예. 물론입니다.”

이어 그의 입술 사이로 생전 처음 들어보는 명칭이 흘러나왔다.

“이건…… 마나 연공법입니다.”

“마나, 뭐요?”

“마나 연공법 말입니다!”

마나 연공법(Mana-練功法)?

거, 누가 지었는지 이름 한 번 괴상하다.

그때 최 팀장의 커진 목소리를 들은 김 집사가 후다닥 다가갔다.

“지금 마나 연공법이라고 하셨습니까?”

“네, 여기.”

최 팀장으로부터 비급을 건네받은 김 집사가 황급히 페이지를 넘겼다.

그리고 얼마 지나지 않아 비슷한 반응이 터져 나왔다.

“헉.”

“김 집사님이 보시기에 어떻습니까?”

“확실합니다. 마나 연공법이 분명해요. 그런데 도대체 이걸 어디서?”

화장실에서 가져왔는데요.

최 팀장이 손가락을 들어 나를 가리켰다.

“진태경 씨가…….”

“진태경 헌터님이요?”

휙! 우두둑!

최 팀장의 말이 끝나기도 전에 김 집사의 고개가 맹렬한 소리와 함께 내 쪽을 향해 꺾였다.

“진태경 헌터님께서 어떻게 마나 연공법을 갖고 계신 겁니까?”

나는 침착하게 대답했다.

“일단 저는 마나 연공법이 뭔지 모르고요. 당연히 저게 마나 연공법이라는 것 역시 금시초문입니다. 그나저나 목은 괜찮으세요? 방금 뼈 부러지는 소리가 들린 것 같은데…….”

“지금 그게 대수입니까? 이깟 목, 부러져도 됩니다.”

“……엄청 대수인 것 같은데.”

되긴 뭐가 돼. 이 할아버지, 어째 날이 갈수록 터프해지시는 것 같다.

물론 그만큼 이 문제가 중요하다는 뜻이겠지만.

‘그나저나 마나 연공법이라. 이정룡이 그걸 익힌 거구나.’

일종의 합성어라 처음에는 괴상하게 들렸는데, 몇 번 중얼거려보니 혀에 착 감긴다.

단어에 담긴 뜻으로 헌터들이 쓰는 내공심법이라는 걸 유추하기는 그리 어렵지 않았다.

그리고 이정룡과 그 수하들이 익힌 것이 바로 이 마나 연공법이라는 것도.

“제 질문에 대한 답을 부탁드려도 되겠습니까?”

“태경 씨, 이건 매우 중요한 문제입니다.”

김 집사와 최 팀장의 눈빛은 그 어느 때보다 진지하고 심각했다.

나는 짐짓 당황한 것처럼 눈을 굴리다가, 미리 준비해 온 대답을 던졌다.

“글쎄요. 어릴 적에 아버지께서 알려 주신 거라…….”

“외람되지만 혹시 돌아가신 선친(先親)을 말씀하시는 겁니까?”

“네.”

최 팀장이 미간을 좁혔다.

“선친께서는 일반인이셨던 것으로 압니다만.”

“맞아요.”

“그런데 어떻게 마나 연공법을……?”

“아마 아버지도 모르셨을 겁니다. 저한테 알려 주시면서 집안 대대로 내려오는 건강요법이라고만 말씀해 주셨거든요.”

“네? 건강요법이요?”

“집안 대대로 내려오는 마나 연공법이라니.”

믿을 수 없다는 표정을 짓는 두 사람을 향해 표지 겉면을 가리켰다.

오피스 문서의 폰트처럼 정갈한 글씨체로 적힌 네 글자.



[진가심법]



이름부터 딱 좋다.

산서성에 태원진가가 있다면 경기도에는 고양진가가 있다, 이 말이야.

집안에 대대로 내려온 가보(家寶)라고 하면 저쪽에서도 딱히 할 말이 없을 거다.

내 예상대로 순간 말문이 막힌 두 사람을 보며 말을 이었다.

“일종의 호흡법인데, 익히면 건강해진다고 어렸을 때부터 가르쳐 주셨어요. 구결(口訣)이라는 것도 달달 외우게 시키셨고.”

“마나 연공법과 비슷하긴 한데…….”

“원본, 원본을 볼 수 있겠습니까?”

“아버지께서 돌아가신 후에 워낙 경황이 없어서…… 이사하고 나서 찾아봤는데 없어졌더라고요.”

“아…….”

“저런.”

“안타까운 일이죠. 제가 토씨 한 글자 안 빼놓고 외워 놓아서 그나마 다행이지만.”

사라진 물건이 있다는 말은 사실이다. 단지 그 와중에 있지도 않은 진가심법의 비급을 끼워 넣었을 뿐.

완벽한 증거 인멸. 원본마저 없어졌다는 말에 두 사람이 어깨가 축 늘어지는 것이 보였다.

‘이게 원본인 걸 알면 표정들 볼 만하겠는데.’

사람들이 생각하는 무공 비급의 형태는 다 비슷비슷하다.

반쯤 삭아 버린 죽간(竹竿). 쥐 오줌 냄새가 나는 고서(古書).

족구 하라고 해라. 난 그딴 거 없다.

빳빳한 A4 용지 뭉텅이를 반듯하게 세워 스테이플러를 쾅 찍었다. 무림인들이 보면 기가 차겠지만, 21세기 무공 비급이라면 이 정도는 되어야지.

“그나저나 대단하군요. 심법이라, 이런 것이 있을 줄은 상상도 못 했습니다.”

“소설이나 영화에서 몇 번 언급되는 걸 봤습니다. 이런 걸 무공이라고 했던 것 같은데.”

“도련님이 생각하신 것이 맞습니다. 마나 연공법도 어떻게 보면 일종의 무공이지요. 이 부분을 보시면 운기(運氣)를 통해 기를 순환시키고 축적시킨다고 적혀 있지 않습니까? 이건 마나 연공법과 같은 맥락의…….”

어, 그거 무공 맞아.

근질거리는 입을 참고 있을 때, 최 팀장이 물었다.

“그럼 진태경 씨는 마나 연공법을, 아니 진가심법을 어릴 때부터 죽 수련해 오신 겁니까?”

“네.”

“이런 말씀을 드리기에는 죄송합니다만, 그동안 생각보다 효과가…….”

직역하자면 ‘그런 놈이 왜 7년 동안 F급 헌터로 살았냐?’라는 뜻. 날카로운 질문이다. 예상했던 질문이기도 하고.

나는 태연한 얼굴로 입을 열었다.

“아시겠지만, 제가 F급 헌터치고는 실력이 꽤 좋았죠. 훈련소에서도 수석으로 표창장 받았고.”

“아, 그 부분은 들어서 알고 있습니다. 예전에 몸담으셨던 길드에서 부팀장 직을 맡으셨던 것도요.”

그래봤자 코딱지만 한 약소 길드였지만, F급 헌터는 어딜 가나 동네북이고 길거리 개똥 취급받기 마련이다.

길드 수뇌부와 혈연관계가 아닌 이상 F급 헌터가 부팀장 역할을 맡는 경우는 매우 드문 일. 그렇기에 내가 부팀장이 된 것은 한동안 길드 내에서도 화젯거리였다.

“그것 때문에 말 많았었어요. 연차가 어쩌구, 저보다 등급 높고 경력 있는 헌터들은 연공서열 따지면서 투덜거리고…… 결국 실력으로 증명했습니다. 그럴 수 있었던 이유가 진가심법이고요.”

“으음.”

“그런 걸 보면 확실히 효과가 있는 것 같긴 합니다만.”

안다. 이 정도로는 내 과거와 진가심법의 효과를 납득시키기 힘들다는 것을.

나는 빙긋 웃으며 사람들을 바라봤다. 어느새 구역질을 멈춘 송송이와 임꺽정까지 호기심 가득한 눈빛으로 내 입을 주시하는 중이었다.

# Chapter 290

> **Grade:** None

I stared at the Skill information window and thought.

*Hold on. When did I get this?*

*Was it when I achieved Great Completion in the Jin Family's Manoeuvre Technique? Or the Jin Family's Spear Technique?*

It had been over a year, so my memory was hazy.

I had somehow received the Skill, but I had never used it even once because I had no opportunity to do so.

*No, that's not quite right. It wasn't that I had no opportunity. I just never intended to use it.*

Whenever I faced the members of Peace Guild after returning to the modern world, I occasionally felt the urge. But every time, I reached the same final conclusion.

*What kind of trouble would I get into if I leaked martial arts?*

Imagine one person fighting with bronze weapons when some idiot showed up with a steel sword and started hacking everyone apart.

Everyone would envy him, and they'd swarm him like a pack of dogs to get their hands on that steel sword.

It wasn't that I didn't trust the members of Peace Guild, but at least at the time, I thought it was the right decision.

*But there's no reason to hesitate anymore.*

After directly crossing blows with Lee Jungryong and his subordinates, Park Jihoon and Go Jun, I had realized that there were secrets in the modern world I knew nothing about.

Their movements and use of mana were clearly closer to those of Murim people. If the enemy was armed with steel swords, we needed to equip ourselves with something similar.

“Hoo…”

As I drew in a deep breath, the foul stench was sucked into my nostrils.

The place where I was squatting right now was a bathroom stall.

The environment was terrible, but it was the perfect place to avoid being seen while creating a martial arts manual.

*Then let's get started.*

I spread out the A4 paper and pen I had bought from the convenience store inside the hospital.

Then I muttered inwardly.

*Activate Martial Arts Manual Creation.*

Beep.

None of the Fire Gate Clan's martial arts I had learned had reached Great Completion.

The Jin Family of Taiyuan's hereditary martial arts, on the other hand, were stable, and their power was just right.

Of those, I chose the most fundamental one.

*Select Jin Family's Cultivation Technique.*

Beep.

*Yes.*

Beep! Beep!

“...You bastards. Seriously.”

With tears of blood streaming down my face, I opened my Status Window.

As I invested my precious points into Intelligence, the hand holding the pen began to race across the A4 paper like lightning.

Scritch-scritch-scritch-scritch!

“Gasp!”

I was surprised twice.

Once by that incredible speed, and a second time by the fact that everything being written was in Chinese.

“...”

Fuck, I can't work like this.

I began searching for the language settings.

* * *

Slide.

I entered the hospital room where the Peace Guild members were staying. The people who had been huddled together talking turned their heads toward me.

“Where did you go that took so long... Wait, did you go to the bathroom?”

At Song Song's words, spoken while she held her nose, I answered gloomily.

“How did you know?”

“The smell of shit was overwhelming.”

“Is it that bad?”

“Yeah. It felt like a giant turd was walking toward me.”

“Thanks for the kind words. I feel invigorated.”

After spending more than an hour inside a stinking bathroom stall, my nose had gone numb.

I answered in a completely drained voice and handed her the stack of A4 pages I had stapled together.

“Here.”

“What is this?”

“A love letter for you. I wrote it while having diarrhea.”

“Blech! Bleegh!”

“What a passionate reaction.”

“Bleeeggh!”

“...”

That wasn't a reaction. She was genuinely sick.

I thought things between us were already over, but I couldn't help the dull ache in a corner of my heart.

“I loved you...”

“Bleeeggh!”

“Hunter Song Song, are you all right?”

As her retching grew more violent, Butler Kim flew over to pat her on the back.

In the meantime, the A4 pages Song Song had been waving around like the Taegeukgi[^1] passed into someone else's hands.

After reading the words on the first page, Team Leader Choi let out a quiet laugh as he looked at me.

“Jin Family's Cultivation Technique? That's an unusual title for a love letter.”

“The contents are even more unusual.”

“...Pardon?”

“Keep reading.”

Team Leader Choi was quick on the uptake. He immediately straightened his posture and turned the pages with a solemn expression.

A pair of eyes moved busily over handwriting so mechanical that it was hard to believe I had written it myself.

Flip. Flip. Flip…

His pace grew faster and faster, and hot breaths escaped between his lips.

After rapidly reading through more than ten pages, he suddenly lifted his head. His eyes had widened like trays.

“This is...!”

His reaction surprised even me.

*He knows what this is?*

It was called a martial arts manual, but once I had actually created it, the manual for the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique looked enough like a book of traditional medicine that anyone unfamiliar with it might mistake it for one.

It showed the locations and functions of the countless acupoints in the human body, along with the paths used to circulate internal energy.

Song Song would have read a few pages and closed it, but Team Leader Choi's reaction was far beyond what I had expected.

“Do you recognize what this is?”

“Yes. Of course.”

Then a name I was hearing for the first time slipped between his lips.

“This is a Mana Cultivation Method.”

“A mana what?”

“A Mana Cultivation Method!”

*Mana Cultivation Method?*

What a bizarre name. Whoever came up with it had a strange naming sense.

At that moment, Butler Kim hurried over after hearing Team Leader Choi's raised voice.

“Did you just say Mana Cultivation Method?”

“Yes, here.”

Butler Kim took the manual from Team Leader Choi and frantically turned the pages.

Before long, he gave a similar reaction.

“Gasp.”

“What do you think, Butler Kim?”

“It’s certain. This is definitely a Mana Cultivation Method. But where on earth did you...?”

I got it from the bathroom.

Team Leader Choi raised a finger and pointed at me.

“Mr. Jin Taekyung...”

“Hunter Jin Taekyung?”

Whip! Crack!

Before Team Leader Choi could even finish speaking, Butler Kim's head snapped toward me with a violent sound.

“How does Hunter Jin Taekyung possess a Mana Cultivation Method?”

I answered calmly.

“For starters, I don't know what a Mana Cultivation Method is. Naturally, this is the first I've heard of this being one. By the way, is your neck all right? I think I just heard a bone break...”

“Is that important right now? This little neck of mine can break for all I care.”

“...It sounds pretty important to me.”

What do you mean, it can break? This old man seemed to be getting tougher by the day.

Of course, that only meant this matter was that important.

*So Lee Jungryong learned a Mana Cultivation Method.*

It had sounded strange at first because it was a kind of compound word, but after muttering it a few times, it rolled smoothly off my tongue.

It wasn't difficult to infer from the meaning of the word that this was the internal cultivation technique used by Hunters.

And that this was precisely what Lee Jungryong and his subordinates had learned.

“Could you answer my question, please?”

“Taekyung, this is an extremely important matter.”

Butler Kim and Team Leader Choi looked more serious than ever.

I rolled my eyes as if flustered, then gave them the answer I had prepared in advance.

“Well, my father taught it to me when I was young...”

“Pardon me, but are you referring to your late father?”

“Yes.”

Team Leader Choi furrowed his brow.

“I understand your late father was an ordinary man.”

“That’s right.”

“Then how did he know a Mana Cultivation Method...?”

“He probably didn't know either. When he taught it to me, he told me it was just a health regimen passed down through our family.”

“A health regimen?”

“A Mana Cultivation Method passed down through the family...”

I pointed at the cover as the two of them stared at me in disbelief.

Four neat characters were written on it in a font as orderly as that of an office document.

**Jin Family's Cultivation Technique**

The name was perfect.

If there was a Jin Family of Taiyuan in Shanxi Province, then there was a Jin Family of Goyang in Gyeonggi Province. That was all there was to it.

If I claimed it was a family heirloom passed down through the generations, they wouldn't have much to say.

Just as I had expected, both of them were briefly rendered speechless. I continued.

“It’s a kind of breathing method. My father taught it to me from a young age, saying it would make me healthier if I practiced it. He even made me memorize something called a formula.”

“It is similar to a Mana Cultivation Method, but...”

“Could we see the original? The original manual?”

“After my father passed away, I was too distracted by everything that happened... I looked for it after we moved, but it was gone.”

“Ah...”

“That’s unfortunate.”

“It is. Fortunately, I memorized every word of it.”

It was true that something I owned had disappeared. I had simply inserted the nonexistent original manual for the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique into the story.

Perfect destruction of evidence. When I said even the original was gone, I could see both of their shoulders droop.

*It would be interesting to see their faces if they knew this was the original.*

The martial arts manuals people imagined all looked more or less the same.

Half-rotted bamboo slips. Ancient books that smelled of rat urine.

Tell them to go play jokgu.[^2] I don't have any of that crap.

I stood the stiff stack of A4 paper neatly upright and slammed a stapler into it. Murim people would have been aghast, but a twenty-first-century martial arts manual had to look something like this.

“By the way, this is incredible. A cultivation technique... I never imagined something like this existed.”

“I’ve seen things like this mentioned a few times in novels and movies. I think they called them martial arts.”

“You are right, Young Master. In a way, a Mana Cultivation Method is also a form of martial arts. If you look here, it says that channeling circulates and accumulates qi, doesn’t it? This follows the same general principle as a Mana Cultivation Method...”

*Yeah, it is martial arts.*

While I held back the words itching to escape my mouth, Team Leader Choi asked,

“So, Mr. Jin Taekyung, you’ve been practicing Mana Cultivation Method—or rather, the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique—since you were young?”

“Yes.”

“I’m sorry to put it this way, but its effects seem to have been somewhat less impressive than expected...”

Translated directly, he was asking, *If you had this, why did you spend seven years as an F-rank Hunter?* It was a sharp question. And one I had expected.

I calmly opened my mouth.

“As you know, I was quite skilled for an F-rank Hunter. I even received a commendation as the top graduate of my training center.”

“Ah, yes. I’ve heard about that. I also know that you served as a deputy team leader at your former Guild.”

It had been a tiny, weak Guild, but F-rank Hunters were treated like punching bags wherever they went and like dog shit on the street.

Unless they were related by blood to the Guild's leadership, it was extremely rare for an F-rank Hunter to serve as a deputy team leader. That was why my appointment had been a subject of conversation within the Guild for quite some time.

“There was a lot of talk about it. People complained about seniority and all that, while Hunters with higher ranks and more experience than me grumbled about the pecking order... In the end, I proved myself through my ability. And the reason I was able to do that was the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique.”

“Hmm.”

“Looking at that, it does seem to have had an effect.”

I knew it. This alone wouldn't be enough to convince them of my past or the effectiveness of the Jin Family's Cultivation Technique.

I smiled faintly as I looked at the others. By then, Song Song had stopped retching, and even Im Kkeokjeong was watching my mouth with eyes full of curiosity.
