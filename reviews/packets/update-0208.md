Return exactly one JSON object and no Markdown fence. Record only facts established
by this chapter. Do not use tools, edit prose, infer future events, or copy archived
profile continuity.

1 and safe_through 208. Keep at most
2 continuity_sources. Keep
`active_continuity` to at most 20 concise items, `open_questions` to at most 8
items, and `temporary_decisions` to at most 8 items. Keep the serialized context
under 16384 UTF-8 bytes. Use only chapter
numbers through 208. `profile_updates` may replace one exact, uniquely occurring
complete line in a listed profile, and only an Aliases, Role, Personality, Voice, or
Relationships line. Use `profile_creations` only for a newly introduced named
character without a listed profile. Filenames must be plain `.md` basenames.
`names` contains only newly required Korean-to-English rows; Korean keys must occur
in the source. `address_pairs` contains only newly required speaker→addressee rows;
each Korean key must occur in the source or already appear in the address ledger,
and at least one endpoint must occur in the source (first-person narrators may be

종횡무진(縱橫無盡).

지금의 내 모습이 그랬다. 눈에 보이고 손이 닿는 곳마다 거침없이 베고, 찌르고, 박살 냈다. 창날이 번뜩일 때마다 피가 솟구치고 살과 뼈가 갈라졌다.

나는 아무런 제약도 받지 않고 거대한 오우거들의 사이를 거침없이 누볐다.

서걱! 콰드드득!

- 구워어어억!

단말마와 함께 3m에 달하는 거체가 무릎을 꿇는다.

게이트는 계속해서 오우거들을 쏟아 냈지만 내게는 아무런 문제도 되지 않았다. 두 마리가 나오면 셋을 죽였고, 세 마리가 나오면 넷을 죽였다.

‘쉽다. 신기할 정도로.’

포인트를 적용시켰던 것은 철우와의 비무가 마지막.

그러나 임독양맥의 타통은 공력의 제어와 폭발력, 그리고 감각을 극도로 상승시켰다.

엄청난 거력이 담긴 오우거들의 쇠몽둥이가 사방에서 내리꽂혀도 한없이 느리게 보일 뿐이다.

내 눈에 비친 놈들은 가진 힘을 제대로 활용할 줄 모르는 멍청이에 불과했다.

쐐애애액! 퍽!

- 그르르륵…….

피가래 끓는 소리와 함께 몇 번째인지 모를 오우거가 무릎을 꿇었다.

자신의 목젖을 정확히 꿰뚫은 창날을 움켜잡으려던 털북숭이 손바닥이 힘을 잃고 툭, 떨어진다.

띠링.



- [Lv.85 오우거]를 해치웠습니다!

- 상당량의 경험치를 획득합니다!

- 레벨 업!



“오.”

벌써 레벨 업이라니.

이거 혼자서 쓸어 버리니까 경험치 빨아들이는 속도가 장난이 아니다.

‘잡는 놈들마다 하나같이 나보다 고레벨이라 그런가.’

지금 내 레벨이 70대 중후반이니 오우거들과는 적게는 5레벨, 많게는 10레벨 차이다.

그런 놈들을 정육점 목살처럼 서걱서걱 썰어 버리니 금방 레벨이 오를 수밖에.

경험치가 생각 이상으로 되게 쏠쏠한데?

‘아니, 잠깐만.’

순간 뇌리를 스치는 한 줄기 생각.

나는 반짝이는 눈으로 꿀렁거리며 오우거를 뱉어 내는 게이트를 바라봤다.

이거 완전히…….

‘맛집이잖아.’

게이트에서는 계속해서 경험치, 아니 몬스터를 뱉어 내고 나는 죽이고. 그렇게 꾸준히 반복한다면?

‘회전 초밥집이 여기 있었구나.’

오우거에게서 얻는 경험치는 참치 대뱃살보다 달콤하다.

나오는 족족 꼭꼭 씹어서 포인트로 소화할 생각에 입꼬리가 올라가던 그때였다.

우우웅. 투타타타타!

- 정지, 정지!

- 강하!

거센 바람 소리와 함께 날아온 전투 헬기 서너 대가 머리 위를 맴돌더니, 이십여 명의 헌터들이 벼락처럼 떨어져 내렸다.

슈슈슈슉!

20m가 넘는 높이. 이 정도면 아무리 마법 장비를 갖춘 헌터라고 해도 무릎에 무리가 가기 마련이다.

그러나 이번에 나타난 이들은 내가 오기 전 있던 사람들 같은 어중이떠중이들이 아니었다.

“페더 폴(Feather Fall)”

마법사의 영창과 함께 허공에서 느껴지는 기의 파동.

빠르고 거칠게 내리꽂히던 신체가 속도를 늦췄다. 쇠몽둥이를 휘두르려던 오우거들이 타이밍을 놓치고 머뭇거릴 때, 두 번째 마법이 발현되었다.

“그리스(Grease)!”

- 구워어?

쿵! 콰당!

남아 있던 네 마리의 오우거가 중심을 잃고 휘청거리거나 주저앉았다.

“지금!”

외침과 동시에 속도 감속 마법이 해제되며 근접 딜러들이 빛살처럼 날아들었다.

죽음을 직감한 오우거들이 낮은 울음소리를 흘린 그 순간이었다.

캉! 카가강!

“……어?”

놈들의 가슴에 막 무기를 꽂아 넣으려던 헌터들이 황당하다는 표정으로 나를 바라봤다.

‘이 새끼가 지금 무슨 짓을 한 거지?’

‘제정신인가.’

딱 그 표정이다.

단 한 번의 휘두름으로 헌터들의 공격을 걷어 낸 내가 점잖은 목소리로 말했다.

“거, 상도의는 지킵시다.”

“…….”

이 새끼들이 어디서 다 잡은 몹을 스틸하려고.



* * *



“그런 일이 있었어?”

자초지종을 들은 대위의 말에 헌터 팀장이 고개를 끄덕였다.

“예, 제가 지원팀 2년째 하면서 그런 놈은 처음 본다니까요.”

“재미있는 사람이네.”

“재밌기는. 완전 또라이죠.”

“글쎄.”

대위는 천천히 주위를 둘러봤다.

원래 형태를 찾아볼 수 없을 만큼 무너진 톨게이트, 반파된 도로에는 몬스터들의 피가 점점이 뿌려져 있었다.

뒤집히고 부서진 자동차들도 보였지만 몇 대 되지 않는다.

“사상자가 몇이나 되지?”

군인과 헌터. 비록 신분은 다르지만 둘 다 정부에는 군 지원팀 소속으로 등록되어 있다.

상관 격인 대위의 질문에 헌터 팀장이 냉큼 대답했다.

“일단 사망 넷. 중상 다섯이요. 더 파악해 봐야 알겠지만.”

“사망 넷, 중상 다섯이라.”

덤덤하게 읊조린 대위가 말을 이었다.

“게이트 발생이 오늘만 두 번째네.”

“그러게요. 한 시간 전쯤에 양주 쪽에서 F급 게이트 하나 터졌으니까. 이거 진짜 무슨 일 나는 거 아닌지 모르겠어요.”

헌터 팀장의 말에 대위가 혀를 찼다.

“야, 정 팀장아.”

“네.”

“읍내에서 터진 F급 게이트. 출근길 도로 한가운데에서 터진 B급 게이트. 뭐가 더 심각해 보이냐?”

“그야…….”

“근데 사상자는 F급 게이트 쪽이 더 많았어. 사망자 열 명에 중상은 스물이 넘는다.”

“예? 그럴 리가요. 뉴스 속보에서는…….”

“축소, 은폐. 너도 2년째면 슬슬 감 잡아야지. 여기가 어떤 곳인지.”

대위가 깊은 한숨을 내쉬었다.

“우리 입장에서는 백 번 절해도 모자라. 혼자서 대참사를 막은 시민 영웅 아니냐.”

“그건 그렇죠. 좀 또라이 같긴 한데.”

“정 팀장.”

“아, 아니 그게 아니고요. 엄청 강한 또라이라는 거죠. 혼자서 오우거를 열 마리도 넘게 잡았으니까 A급 헌터는 되는 것 같은데.”

“어쨌든 말조심해라. 듣는 귀도 많은데.”

“다 우리 애들인데 듣는 귀는 무슨…… 아.”

대위가 턱짓하는 곳을 바라본 팀장이 인상을 팍 찡그렸다.

고가의 카메라를 든 빼빼 마른 중년인이 신난 발걸음으로 그들을 향해 다가오고 있었다.

“이야, 유 대위님! 정 팀장! 지금까지 어디 숨어 계셨어? 한참 찾았네.”

헌터 팀장이 영 고까운 얼굴로 대답했다.

“김 기자님 피해서요.”

“어우, 정 팀장은 오늘따라 왜 이렇게 까칠해? 나도 지원팀 소속이야.”

“이럴 때만 팀원이고 군종 기잡니까? 평소에는 맨날 숙취에 찌들어 계시더니 특종 하나 잡았다고 너무 좋아하시는 거 아니에요?”

움찔한 기자를 대신해서 대위가 나섰다.

“그쯤 해. 김 기자님도 앞으로 유의하시고요. 엄연히 사고 현장인데 특종 잡았다고 혼자서 신나 하는 모습이 좋게 보이진 않습니다.”

“……큼. 뭐, 앞으로 주의하겠습니다.”

대답하면서도 기자의 눈빛은 기대감으로 반짝 빛났다.

게이트 발생은 말 그대로 천재지변이나 다름없다. 아니, 어떤 면에서는 천재지변 이상이다.

태풍이 한반도를 덮친다고 하면 언제, 어떻게 올지. 어느 지역이 피해를 입을지 예측이라도 할 수 있지만 게이트 생성은 종잡을 수 없기 때문이다.

‘하루에 게이트가 두 번 터진 것도 전대미문인데, 심지어 B급 게이트라.’

맥없이 뚫린 톨게이트 경비팀과 출근길에 대참사를 막은 이름 모를 헌터의 영웅 같은 등장!

그림이 좋다.

이미 머릿속에서 스케치를 끝낸 기자는 몸이 잔뜩 달았다.

“그래서, 우리 영웅님은 어디 계셔? A급 헌터지? 이름은 뭐래요? 이런 건 좀 신선한 뉴 페이스가 먹히는데.”

“뉴 페이스요? 나 참.”

눈살을 찌푸린 헌터 팀장이 기자의 등 뒤를 가리켰다.

“저기 있습니다. 뉴 페이스.”

“어디? 안 보이는데?”

아무리 사방을 둘러봐도 번쩍거리는 갑옷을 걸친 영웅의 모습은 보이지 않는다.

바쁘게 사고 현장을 수습 중인 군 소속 직원들만 보일 뿐.

주위를 바쁘게 훑던 기자의 눈이 딱 멈췄다.

“저기, 정 팀장님. 혹시 저 사람이야? 오우거 사체 앞에…….”

“츄리닝 바지 입은 사람. 예, 맞습니다.”

스슥, 서걱, 서걱.

김장하는 것처럼 쭈그려 앉아 솜씨 좋게 지방과 살, 가죽을 분리해 내는 청년의 뒷모습에 기자가 중얼거렸다.

“……저건 너무 뉴 페이슨데?”

“신선하죠. 원하던 그림 아니에요?”

“신선해 보이긴 하네. 오우거 고기가.”

“아까부터 저러고 있어요. 직원들이 해 준다는데 손도 못 대게 해요. 다 자기 거라고.”

더 웃긴 건 도축 솜씨가 기가 막히게 좋다는 것이다. 실제로 도축 담당 직원 둘은 힐끗거리며 그의 손놀림을 따라 하는 중이었다.

“A급 헌터 맞아?”

“글쎄요. 혼자서 오우거를 쓸어 버릴 정도면 분명한데 보면 볼수록 영.”

“정 팀장이 물어봤는데, 우선 도축 끝내고 얘기하자더군요.”

세 사람이 믿음과 불신이 뒤섞인 눈빛을 교환하던 그때였다.

“휴, 끝났다.”

그토록 질기다는 오우거 고기를 고등어처럼 토막 낸 A급 헌터가 허리를 펴고 일어났다.

무릎이 늘어난 트레이닝복 바지에 삼선 슬리퍼를 본 기자가 중얼거렸다.

“돈도 많이 버는 인간이 왜 저러고 산대.”

이게 기만인가?

어이가 없었지만 한편으로는 볼수록 신선했다. 뭐니 뭐니 해도 미디어에서 가장 중요한 건 캐릭터니까.

‘소탈하고 정의감 투철한 A급 헌터라, 이거 그림은 잘 뽑히겠는데? 얼굴도 시원시원하니 잘생겼고.’

그래, 번듯하고 모범생 같은 이미지보다 차라리 이게 더 낫다.

기자는 씩 웃으며 카메라를 들었다.

설정이 하나도 들어가 있지 않은 자연스러운 컷을 따기 위해서였다.



* * *



‘역시 오우거야. 버릴 게 없지.’

나는 깔끔하게 분리된 부산물을 보며 흡족한 미소를 머금었다.

오우거는 말 그대로 힘의 상징 같은 존재라 남성들에게 인기가 많다.

찾는 사람은 많은데 엄연히 B급 최상위로 분류되는 몬스터인지라 공급은 부족한 편이었다.

‘급소만 찌르길 잘했다.’

콧노래를 흥얼거리며 부산물을 분류하던 그때였다.

찰칵.

“……응?”

난데없이 들려온 기계음을 찾아 고개를 돌렸다.

연달아 카메라 셔터를 누르던 중년인이 나를 향해 사람 좋게 웃어 보였다.

“아이고, 놀라셨구나?”

뭐야, 이 인간은.

나는 황당해져서 물었다.

“보통은 도촬 당하면 놀라지, 좋아합니까?”

“좋아하실 수도 있죠. 내일 신문 나가면.”

“신문이요?”

“아, 제 소개가 늦었구나. 우선 명함부터 받으시죠.”

밀리터리 무늬가 박혀 있는 명함을 받아들고 읽었다.

“군종 기자.”

“수방사 아시죠? 수도방위사령부. 저는 25 지원팀 소속 군종 기잡니다.”

“아아, 네.”

“그리고 제 뒤에 오시는 두 분이 지원팀 이거.”

웃으며 엄지를 치켜세우는 기자의 등 뒤로 두 사람이 다가왔다.

각기 특전사 군복에 갑옷을 입은 그들은 뭐랄까, 전형적인 군인과 헌터의 복장이었다.

“반갑습니다. 25 지원팀장 대위 유시진입니다.”

“아, 예.”

어쩐지 태양이 후회할 것 같은 이름인데.

나는 고개를 갸웃거리며 두 사람과 통성명을 주고받았다.

대충 자기소개와 큰일을 하셨다는 공치사가 끝나기가 무섭게 아까부터 뜨거운 눈빛을 보내고 있던 군종 기자가 입을 열었다.

“진태경 헌터님이라고 하셨죠?”

“네. 그런데요.”

“제가 맡고 있는 분야가 분야다 보니 어지간한 A급 헌터 분들은 다 알거든요. 그런데…….”

아, 무슨 말을 하려는지 대충 알겠다.

언제고 한 번쯤은 겪어야 할 일이기도 했다.

나는 선선히 대답해 주었다.

“저 A급 아닌데요.”

“예?”

“물론 S급 헌터도 아니고요.”

“……?”

동시에 물음표가 떠오른 세 사람의 얼굴을 마주하자 나도 모르게 실소가 새어 나왔다. 이거 재밌네.

‘이세계에서 이리 치이고 저리 치이던 내가 현실에서는 힘을 숨김.’

소설 제목으로 써도 되겠다.

내가 말없이 웃고만 있자 기자가 더듬거리는 목소리로 입을 열었다.

“그, 그럼 혹시 B급.”

“아뇨. C급인데요.”

“……C급이요? C컵 말고 C급?”

“예.”

C컵은 무슨 개소리를 하고 있어. 내 가슴은 또 왜 봐.

나는 쏟아지는 불신의 눈빛들을 뒤로하고 말을 이었다.

“길드로 출근하는 길이었는데 우연히 게이트가 열리는 바람에…….”

“그, 그래서요?”

“아.”

다급한 기자의 질문에 나는 대답할 수 없었다. 잠깐 잊고 있던 사실이 떠올랐기 때문이었다.

“……혹시 지금 몇 시죠?”

젠장, 지각이네.

# Chapter 208

Unstoppable in every direction.

That was me now. Wherever my eyes could see and my hands could reach, I cut, stabbed, and smashed without restraint. Every time the spearhead flashed, blood spurted, and flesh and bone split apart.

I moved freely among the enormous ogres without the slightest hindrance.

Srrk! Krrrunch!

—Gwooooooar!

With a death rattle, the three-meter-tall body dropped to its knees.

The Gate continued spewing out ogres, but they posed no problem for me. When two came out, I killed three. When three came out, I killed four.

*This is easy. Almost ridiculously so.*

The last time I had applied points was during my duel with Chulwoo.

But opening my Conception and Governor Vessels had pushed my control and explosive power over my internal energy, along with my senses, to an extreme level.

Even when the ogres’ iron clubs, packed with immense force, came crashing down from every direction, they looked unbelievably slow.

The ogres in my eyes were nothing more than idiots who had no idea how to use their strength properly.

Whoooosh! Thud!

—Grrrgh…

Another ogre, one of countless by now, dropped to its knees with a wet, blood-choked rattle.

The furry hand that had tried to grasp the spearhead piercing straight through its Adam’s apple suddenly lost its strength and fell limply to the ground.

Ding.



> **System**
>
> - You have defeated **Lv.85 Ogre**!
>
> - You have acquired a considerable amount of EXP!
>
> - Level Up!

“Oh.”

I had already leveled up.

The rate at which I was sucking up EXP while clearing them out by myself was no joke.

*Is it because every one of these bastards is higher-level than me?*

My current Level was somewhere in the mid-to-high seventies, so I was five to ten Levels below the ogres.

Since I was slicing them up like pork shoulder at a butcher shop, it was only natural that my Level would rise quickly.

The EXP was far more generous than I had expected.

*No, wait.*

A thought suddenly flashed through my mind.

I gazed at the Gate, which continued to churn and spit out ogres, my eyes shining.

This was completely…

*This is a popular restaurant.*

The Gate kept spitting out EXP—or rather, monsters—and I kept killing them. If that continued steadily, then…

*So this was where the conveyor-belt sushi place was.*

The EXP I got from the ogres was sweeter than tuna belly.

My mouth curved upward as I imagined chewing every ogre that came out and digesting it into points.

That was when it happened.

Vroooom. Rat-a-tat-tat-tat!

—Hold! Hold!

—Descend!

Three or four combat helicopters flew in with the roar of fierce winds, circled overhead, and then dropped around twenty Hunters like lightning.

Shu-shu-shu-shu!

They were falling from a height of more than twenty meters. At that height, even Hunters outfitted with magical Equipment were bound to strain their knees on landing.

But these weren’t the incompetent amateurs who had been here before I arrived.

“Feather Fall.”

With the mage’s incantation, a ripple of energy passed through the air.

The bodies that had been plunging downward quickly and violently began to slow.

The ogres, which had been about to swing their iron clubs, hesitated after missing their timing. Then the second spell was cast.

“Grease!”

—Gwo?

Boom! Crash!

The four remaining ogres lost their balance. Some staggered, while others collapsed onto the ground.

“Now!”

At the shout, the spell slowing their descent was dispelled, and the melee fighters shot forward like streaks of light.

The ogres let out low growls, sensing their imminent deaths.

That was when—

Clang! Clang-clang!

“…Huh?”

The Hunters who had just been about to drive their weapons into the ogres’ chests stared at me with baffled expressions.

*What the hell did this bastard just do?*

*Is he insane?*

That was exactly what their faces said.

I had knocked away all their attacks with a single swing. In a mild voice, I said, “Come on, let’s observe some professional courtesy.”

“…”

These bastards were trying to steal mobs I already had dead to rights.

* * *

“That really happened?”

At the captain’s question, the Hunter Team Leader nodded.

“Yes. I’ve been on the support team for two years, and I’ve never seen anyone like him.”

“He sounds interesting.”

“Interesting? He’s a complete psycho.”

“Perhaps.”

The captain slowly looked around.

The tollgate had collapsed so completely that it was impossible to recognize its original shape. Monster blood was scattered across the half-destroyed road.

There were overturned and wrecked cars as well, but not many.

“How many casualties?”

Soldiers and Hunters had different statuses, but both were registered with the government as members of military support teams.

The Hunter Team Leader promptly answered his superior’s question.

“So far, four dead and five with severe injuries. We’ll know more once we finish checking.”

“Four dead and five with severe injuries.”

The captain repeated the figures calmly before continuing.

“This is the second Gate occurrence today.”

“Tell me about it. An F-rank Gate erupted near Yangju City about an hour ago. I don’t know if something serious is going on.”

The captain clicked his tongue.

“Hey, Team Leader Jeong.”

“Yes, sir.”

“An F-rank Gate that appeared in the town center, or a B-rank Gate that appeared in the middle of a road packed with commuters. Which one looks more serious?”

“Well…”

“But there were more casualties on the F-rank Gate side. Ten dead and more than twenty with severe injuries.”

“What? That can’t be right. The breaking news said…”

“Downplaying it. Covering it up. After two years, you should be getting a feel for what kind of place this is.”

The captain let out a deep sigh.

“From our perspective, a hundred bows wouldn’t be enough to thank him. He’s a civilian hero who stopped a major catastrophe all by himself.”

“That’s true. He does seem a little crazy, though.”

“Team Leader Jeong.”

“Ah, no, that’s not what I meant. I mean he’s an insanely strong crazy person. He killed more than ten ogres by himself, so he must be an A-rank Hunter or something.”

“Either way, watch what you say. There are plenty of ears around.”

“They’re all our people. What ears could there be—ah.”

The Team Leader turned toward the place the captain indicated and immediately scowled.

A skinny, middle-aged man carrying an expensive camera was approaching them with an excited stride.

“Captain Yoo! Team Leader Jeong! Where have you two been hiding? I’ve been looking everywhere.”

The Hunter Team Leader replied with a deeply displeased expression.

“To avoid you, Reporter Kim.”

“Oh, come on. Why are you so prickly today, Team Leader Jeong? I’m part of the support team too.”

“You’re only part of the team at times like this, huh? The rest of the time, you’re a military correspondent. You’re usually drowning in a hangover—aren’t you getting a little too excited just because you landed one scoop?”

The reporter flinched, and the captain stepped in for him.

“That’s enough. And Reporter Kim, please be more careful in the future. This is an accident scene, and running around excitedly because you found a scoop doesn’t look good.”

“…Ahem. I’ll be more careful from now on.”

Even as he answered, the reporter’s eyes sparkled with anticipation.

A Gate occurrence was nothing short of a natural disaster. In some ways, it was even worse.

If a typhoon was going to hit the Korean Peninsula, people could at least predict when and how it would arrive and which areas would suffer damage. The creation of a Gate, however, was impossible to predict.

*Two Gates appearing in one day was unprecedented, and now one of them was even B-rank.*

The tollgate’s security team being helplessly overrun, followed by the heroic appearance of an unknown Hunter who stopped a major catastrophe during rush hour!

It was a great story.

The reporter had already finished sketching it out in his head, and he was practically buzzing with excitement.

“So where’s our hero? He’s an A-rank Hunter, right? What’s his name? A fresh new face would sell better for something like this.”

“A new face? Give me a break.”

The Hunter Team Leader pointed behind the reporter.

“He’s over there. The new face.”

“Where? I don’t see him.”

No matter how many times he looked around, there was no hero wearing gleaming armor in sight.

All he could see were military personnel busily cleaning up the accident scene.

The reporter’s eyes swept frantically over the area before stopping abruptly.

“There, Team Leader Jeong. Is that him? In front of the ogre’s corpse…”

“The man wearing the tracksuit pants? Yes, that’s him.”

Swish. Srrk, srrk.

Squatting like someone making a huge batch of kimchi[^1], the young man deftly separated the fat, meat, and hide from the corpse. The reporter muttered,

“…That’s too new a face.”

“Fresh, right? Isn’t that the picture you wanted?”

“The ogre meat certainly looks fresh.”

“He’s been at it for a while. The staff offered to do it for him, but he won’t let them touch it. Says it’s all his.”

The even funnier part was that his butchering technique was unbelievably good. In fact, the two employees assigned to process the corpses were stealing glances at him and trying to imitate the movements of his hands.

“Is he really an A-rank Hunter?”

“Who knows? If he can wipe out ogres by himself, he definitely should be. But the more I look at him, the less convinced I am.”

“Team Leader Jeong asked him, but he said they could talk once he finished butchering.”

The three men exchanged looks filled with a mixture of belief and doubt.

That was when—

“Whew. Finished.”

The A-rank Hunter, who had cut the notoriously tough ogre meat into pieces like mackerel, straightened his back and stood up.

The reporter looked at the training pants stretched out around the knees and the three-stripe slippers, then muttered,

“Why does a guy who makes that much money live like this?”

*Was this some kind of humblebrag?*

It was absurd, but the longer he looked, the fresher it seemed. After all, the most important thing in the media was character.

*A down-to-earth A-rank Hunter with a fierce sense of justice. This picture could turn out great. He’s handsome, too, with such an open, striking face.*

Yes, this was better than some polished, model-student image.

The reporter grinned and raised his camera.

He wanted to capture a natural shot with absolutely no staging.

* * *

*As expected of an ogre. Nothing to waste.*

I looked over the neatly separated by-products with a satisfied smile.

Ogres were practically symbols of strength, which made them popular among men.

There were plenty of people looking for ogre products, but since ogres were monsters classified as the upper tier of B-rank, the supply was rather limited.

*Good thing I only went for their vital spots.*

I was humming as I sorted the by-products when—

Click.

“…Huh?”

I turned my head toward the mechanical sound that had suddenly come from nowhere.

A middle-aged man who had been pressing his camera shutter repeatedly was smiling amiably at me.

“Oh dear, did I startle you?”

*What the hell is this guy?*

I asked incredulously, “Most people are surprised when they get photographed without permission. Are they supposed to be happy about it?”

“You might be happy when you appear in tomorrow’s newspaper.”

“The newspaper?”

“Ah, I’m afraid I haven’t introduced myself. Here, let’s start with my business card.”

I accepted the business card, which had a military camouflage pattern printed on it, and read it aloud.

“Military correspondent.”

“You know the Capital Defense Command, right? The Capital Defense Command. I’m the military reporter assigned to Support Team 25.”

“Ah, yes.”

“And the two gentlemen coming up behind me are from the support team as well.”

The reporter gave me a smile and raised his thumb as two men approached from behind him.

One wore a Special Forces uniform and the other armor. They were, well, dressed like a stereotypical soldier and Hunter.

“Nice to meet you. I’m Captain Yoo Sijin, Team Leader of Support Team 25.”

“Ah, yes.”

*Somehow, his name sounded less like a descendant of the sun and more like the sun’s regret.*

I tilted my head and exchanged introductions with the two men.

As soon as the perfunctory introductions and praise for the great thing I had done were over, the military reporter, who had been staring at me with fervent eyes, spoke up.

“You said you’re Hunter Jin Taekyung, correct?”

“Yes. Why?”

“Given the field I cover, I know nearly every A-rank Hunter worth knowing. But…”

Ah, I roughly knew what he was trying to say.

It was something I would have to deal with sooner or later.

I answered readily, “I’m not A-rank.”

“What?”

“And I’m not S-rank either, of course.”

“…”

Three question marks seemed to appear on their faces at the same time. I couldn’t help but chuckle. *This was fun.*

*After being knocked around this way and that in another world, I hide my strength in reality.*

That would make a decent novel title.

When I just kept smiling without saying anything, the reporter spoke in a faltering voice.

“Th-Then perhaps you’re B-rank?”

“No. I’m C-rank.”

“…C-rank? You mean C-rank, not C-cup?”

“Yes.”

*What kind of bullshit is C-cup? And why the hell is he looking at my chest?*

I ignored their waves of disbelief and continued, “I was on my way to the Guild when a Gate happened to open…”

“Th-Then what?”

I couldn’t answer the reporter’s urgent question.

I had just remembered something I’d momentarily forgotten.

“…By any chance, what time is it now?”

Damn it. I’m late.
