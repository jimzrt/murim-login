“자네 요즘 얼굴 보기 힘들군.”

“그러게 말입니다. 요즘은 제가 호위인지 총관인지 헷갈립니다.”

위팽의 푸념에 진위경이 실소를 흘렸다.

“며칠만 더 고생해 주게. 그보다 지난번에 말했던 일들은 어떻게 됐나?”

“모든 것이 순조롭습니다. 이번에 거둬들인 문주들도 순종적이고, 관부와 상계도 적극적으로 협력 중입니다.”

태원진가가 순풍을 받은 배라면 진위경은 노련한 선주(船主)였다.

그는 회합 첫날 중소 문파의 충성을 받아 내는 것을 시작으로 굵직한 사안을 하나씩 처리해 나갔다.

무림의 문제는 화왕 적천강이 버티고 있었고, 관부 쪽은 황족인 상산왕이 버티고 있으니 아무런 잡음도 나지 않았다.

‘상계 쪽이야 이미 말할 것도 없고.’

누구보다 이문에 민감한 자들이다. 돈 냄새를 맡았으니 몰려드는 것은 당연했다.

빠르게 머릿속을 정리한 진위경이 위팽에게 물었다.

“예산은? 얼마나 남을 것 같나?”

“부족합니다.”

“뭐?”

깜짝 놀란 진위경의 모습에 위팽의 입꼬리가 솟구쳤다.

“재물을 보관할 창고가 부족하다는 말입니다.”

“……후우.”

“이미 이틀 전에 창고 두 개가 꽉 찼고 이후로 들어온 재물들은 비어 있는 전각에 보관 중입니다.”

안도의 한숨을 내쉰 진위경이 피식 웃었다.

“대박이군.”

“어제 적 대협께서 공표하신 것이 결정적이었습니다. 마지막까지 긴가민가하던 이들에게 확신을 심어 줬으니까요.”

“그들이 진짜 거물이지.”

“맞습니다.”

발이 넓은 자들일수록 가시에 찔릴 가능성도 높다.

지금의 태원 진가는 분명 황금 알을 품은 거위지만 종남파를 포함, 화왕을 통해 불편한 관계를 맺고 있는 거대 문파나 세가도 존재한다.

“잠잠하던 석가장(石家莊)에서 갑자기 독대를 청한 것도 그 때문이겠지.”

석가장은 천하 상계를 주름잡는 거두.

그들이 나섰다는 것은 그만큼 태원 진가의 잠재력에 확신했다는 증거다.

“저울질이야 그네들 특징 아닙니까. 대신 늦은 만큼 선물을 듬뿍 줄 겁니다.”

“당연히 그래야지. 들라 하게.”

“존명.”

위팽이 나가고 얼마 지나지 않아 살이 피둥피둥하게 오른 중년인이 집무실로 들어왔다.

“아이고, 소가주님! 이게 얼마 만입니까!”

“오랜만입니다, 하 총관.”

중년인의 신분은 석가장의 외총관. 비록 다섯 명의 외총관 중 하나에 불과하지만 지닌 권한은 막대하다.

진위경은 연신 땀을 훔치는 그에게 부드럽게 웃어 보였다.

“삼 년 만에 뵙는군요. 장주님께서는 안녕하십니까?”

“한창때 젊은이처럼 정정하시지요. 안 그래도 이번에 경사스러운 소식을 들으시고 한번 뵙고 싶어 하십니다. 소가주께서도 아시다시피 지난번에는 몸이 편찮으셔서…….”

“예, 그랬지요. 알다마다요.”

진위경은 삼 년 전 그날을 똑똑히 기억하고 있었다.

장장 보름을 기다려 독대를 허락받았지만 장주의 얼굴은 보지도 못하고 쫓기듯이 석가장을 나와야 했던 것이다.

석가장의 대문 앞에서 고관대작의 가마를 발견한 것은 우연의 일치다. 그렇게 생각하기로 했다.

‘그게 무림이니까.’

하지만 이제는 위치가 바뀌었다.

지난 삼 년은 짧지만 파란만장한 시간이었고, 자신을 비렁뱅이 취급했던 거만한 외총관은 어느덧 겸손한 장사치가 되어 있었다.

‘이자가 존댓말도 쓸 줄 알았군. 처음 알았어.’

진위경은 묘한 감상에 빠진 채 하 총관의 말을 경청했다.

태원진가의 협조를 받아 산서 상계에 적극적으로 나서고 싶다는 석가장의 제안을 그는 흔쾌히 수락했다.

물론 세부 사안을 검토해 봐야겠지만 석가장의 제안은 후하기 그지없었다.

“생각 이상으로 좋은 제안을 해 주시는군요. 이래도 되나 싶을 만큼.”

하 총관이 손을 비비며 웃었다.

“저는 뼛속부터 장사치입니다. 결코 손해 보는 장사는 하지 않지요.”

상인에도 급이 있다. 삼류는 물건을 맞바꾸고, 이류는 이문을 남길 수 있는 물건을 매입하며, 일류는 미래를 산다.

석가장은 천하에서 손꼽히는 거상(巨商)이다. 그들은 당장의 이문보다는 훗날에 돌아올 수십 배의 이문을 노리고 있다.

‘많이 남겨 먹지는 못할 거요. 본가가 당신네들 손에 놀아날 일은 오지 않을 테니까.’

진위경은 생각과는 달리 활짝 웃어 보였다.

하고 싶은 말, 솔직한 감정을 낱낱이 드러내기에는 세상살이가 쉽지 않다. 교활한 장사치에게는 더더욱.

“머무르실 곳을 내어드리지요. 더 깊은 이야기는 그때 나누도록 합시다.”

“감사합니다, 소가주님.”

자리에서 일어나려던 하 총관이 멈칫했다.

“저어.”

“별다른 용무라도 있습니까?”

“어려운 부탁입니다만, 혹 적천강 대협을 뵐 수 있겠습니까?”

석가장의 외총관은 상당한 권위를 지닌 이름이지만 화왕만큼은 예외다. 그는 태원 진가에 머물기 시작한 이래 귀빈 중 그 누구에게도 독대를 허락하지 않았다.

하 총관이 땀을 닦으며 말을 이었다.

“도무지 쉽지가 않더군요. 직접 찾아가기도 해 보고 수하를 시켜 은밀히 자리를 청했습니다만…….”

“저런. 적 대협께서 좋아하시지 않았을 텐데요.”

“예. 거의 반병신이 돼서 돌아왔습니다. 해서 염치 불고하고 소가주님께 부탁을 드리는 겁니다.”

진위경은 웃음을 삼키며 대답했다.

“글쎄요. 회합이 끝난 후라면 모르겠으나 앞으로 며칠간은 어려울 겁니다.”

“전날부터 안 보이시던데, 연유를 여쭈어봐도 되겠는지요.”

“제 둘째 아우를 지도하고 계실 겁니다.”

“아, 그렇군요. 실례가 많았습니다.”

짧은 탄성을 내뱉은 하 총관이 집무실을 떠나자 진위경은 새어 나오는 웃음을 참을 수 없었다.

며칠간 회합을 주최하며 피곤해진 몸과 정신이 가뿐해지는 기분이다. 그는 유쾌한 목소리로 자신의 충복을 불렀다.

“위팽. 다음은 누군가?”



* * *



미처 해가 뜨지도 않은 새벽.

나를 깨운 것은 혁무진도, 청풍도 아니었다.

촤아아악!

“으헉!”

찬물 세례에 눈을 뜬 내가 처음으로 본 것은 고리눈을 뜨고 있는 적천강이었다.

“뭐, 뭡니까?”

“이 시간까지 퍼 자다니. 제정신이냐?”

“아니, 두 시진밖에 안 잤는데 퍼 자긴 뭘 퍼 잡니까.”

황당해하는 내게 적천강이 잔소리를 퍼부었다.

“두 시진이면 이놈아, 병장기를 휘둘러도 천 번은 더 휘두르겠다. 그리고 스승님께 아침 문안 인사도 안 하는 싸가지는 어디서 배워 먹었누?”

“……스승님이요?”

순간 흠칫한 적천강이 말을 더듬었다.

“우, 우선은 사람들에게 그렇게 보여야 할 것이 아니냐!”

“…….”

“의심을 사지 않기 위해서는 진짜 스승처럼! 진짜 제자처럼 행동하는 것이 기본이다!”

“아, 예.”

무림 메소드 연기의 선구자가 여기 있었구나.

내 미적지근한 반응에 적천강의 얼굴이 벌겋게 달아올랐다.

“여하간 이리 농땡이 피우는 꼴은 못 본다. 썩 따라 나오거라.”

“어디로요?”

“노부가 봐 둔 곳이 있느니라.”

봐 둔 곳이 있다기에 인적이 드문 연무장이라도 찾았나 싶었는데, 적천강을 따라간 곳은 태원진가 내부가 아닌 인근의 산이었다.

몸통 둘레가 수 미터는 가뿐히 넘는 나무가 빼곡했고 지면은 단단했다.

“여기가 적당하겠군.”

넓은 공터에서 발걸음을 멈춘 적천강이 등에 맨 행낭을 그루터기에 올려놓았다.

“그건 뭡니까?”

“신경 꺼라. 나중에 쓸 물건이니까.”

“나중에요?”

“그래, 네 녀석을 즐거움에 몸부림치게 만들 것들이지.”

“…….”

채찍이나 촛대, 가면 같은 물건이 생각나는 건 왜일까.

불안한 눈빛으로 행낭을 곁눈질하고 있자 적천강이 엄한 얼굴로 입을 열었다.

“괜한 관심은 끄고 창이나 꺼내 봐라.”

“아, 예.”

나는 눈치껏 챙겨 온 창 몇 자루를 지면에 꽂았다.

오늘처럼 이른 시간에 적천강이 날 찾아올 이유야 뻔했기 때문이다.

‘수련.’

아닌 척하려고 무던히 애를 쓰지만 내지만 적천강은 나를 제자로 삼고 싶어 한다.

그것을 애써 부정하는 것은 아직 스스로가 확신을 갖지 못했기 때문이다.

‘이미 한 번 뼈아픈 실수를 겪었으니까.’

적천강이 조필에게 입은 마음의 상처는 아직 아물지 않았다.

그렇기에 나라는 놈을 제자로 삼아도 되는지, 끊임없이 지켜보고 생각한 뒤에 결정할 것이 분명했다.

‘당장 열화문의 신공절학을 전수하지는 않더라도 최선을 다해 지도해 주겠지.’

자그마치 초절정 고수의 지도다. 나보다 앞서, 더 먼 길을 정복한 이의 한마디는 천금보다 귀한 법.

균형이 잘 잡힌 철창 한 자루를 들어 올린 나는 침을 꿀꺽 삼켰다.

“이제 뭘 하면 됩니까?”

“덤벼.”

“예?”

“덤비라고 했다. 네 녀석의 모든 힘을 다해서.”

적천강의 주름진 입가에 미소가 떠올랐다.

“한 식경. 노부를 한 걸음이라도 물러서게 만들면 네 승리다.”

띠링.

퀘스트



[일보 후퇴]

화왕 적천강은 당신의 진정한 실력을 보고 싶어 합니다.

제한 시간 내에 그를 물러나게 만들어 자신의 가치를 각인시키십시오!



등급 : 절정

제한 : 진태경

임무 : 일보 후퇴 (미완료)

보상 : ???

실패 : ???





‘한 걸음 물러나게 만들라고?’

얼핏 보면 쉬워 보이지만 괜히 절정 등급이 아니다.

그 상대가 화왕 적천강이라면 더더욱.

퀘스트 창에서 눈을 떼자 여유로운 표정의 적천강이 보였다.

“자, 시작이다.”

삐빅.



29 : 59



허공에 제한 시간 창이 떠오른 그 순간, 나는 지면을 박차고 그를 향해 쇄도했다.

쐐애애액!



* * *



슈왁!

창날이 허공을 찢었다. 압축된 공기가 터져 나가며 노인의 백발이 흩날렸다. 진태경이 처음으로 쏘아 낸 창날을 피한 적천강은 생각했다.

‘이놈, 뭐지?’

빠르다. 그리고 바위도 박살 낼 수 있는 거력이 실려 있었다.

그것은 이미 한차례 진태경의 몸을 살핀 전적이 있는 그로서도 미처 예상하지 못한 속도와 힘이었다.

휘리릭, 쐐애애액! 퍼벙!

이 격, 삼 격, 사 격…….

찍고, 베고, 쳐올린다.

폭우처럼 쏟아져 내리는 창날 세례를 피할 때마다 적천강이 품은 놀라움은 눈덩이처럼 불어났다.

‘노련하다. 마치 전장에서 태어난 놈처럼.’

이제 고작 스물하나. 그러나 창날이 그리는 궤적과 움직임은 어지간한 강호의 명숙(名叔)과 비교해도 부족하지 않다.

아니, 오히려 그 이상이다.

정마대전을 겪으며 숱한 무림인들을 만났던 적천강은 익히 깨달은 바가 있었다.

‘진정한 무인은 수많은 실전 경험을 통해 완성된다.’

구파일방과 오대세가.

그들은 분명 천하를 주름잡는 거대 문파지만 정작 죽음의 기로에서 살아남은 경험이 있는 자들은 소수에 불과했다.

오직 패도(霸道)와 강자지존의 원칙으로 성장한 마교가 중원의 절반을 집어삼킨 이유도 그것에 있었다.

개전 초기, 얼마나 많은 명문 대파의 제자들이 죽어 나갔던가?

‘하지만 이놈은 달라.’

속 빈 강정과 다름없는 기수식(起手式)도, 주저함도 보이지 않는다.

아랑곳하지 않고 전신의 요혈을 노리는 창날과 차갑게 굳은 눈동자는 수많은 실전 경험과 피를 본 자만이 가지는 훈장이다.

쉬리릭, 슈왁!

회전을 머금은 창날이 진동한다. 웅, 웅, 웅.

그 소리는 마치 수백 마리의 벌떼가 날갯짓하는 듯했고, 쏘아지는 창날은 독침보다 날카로웠다.

‘무공을 익힌 지 고작 석 달이라고? 이런 놈이?’

움직임만 보자면 석 달이 아니라 삼 년. 아니, 삼십 년은 된 것 같다.

적천강은 전투로 얼룩진 진태경의 지난 칠 년을 미처 알지 못했다. 다만 감탄할 따름이었다.

‘……대단한 녀석이다.’

적천강 자신도 일평생을 무공에 미쳐 살았던 몸.

그러나 위대한 경지를 이룩한 그에게조차 현재 진태경이 보여 주는 모습은 불가사의, 그 자체였다.

‘고금제일의 무재라 했었나?’

진위경이 했던 말을 떠올린 적천강의 신형이 환희와 경외심에 파르르 떨렸다.

‘그래, 네 말이 맞다.’

여운을 못이겨 스르륵 눈을 감은 그 때였다.

쐐애애액!

가슴을 향해 쏘아지는 빛줄기.

순간 적천강의 눈이 반개했다. 동시에 그의 주름진 손이 창날을 움켜잡았다.

콰직!

어느덧 붉은 염화로 타오르는 두 손이 창날을 부수고 녹인다. 찬바람에 굳어 있던 땅 위로 녹아내린 쇳물이 뚝뚝 떨어졌다.

“……와, 씨. 이거 반칙 아닙니까?”

어이없다는 듯 중얼거리는 진태경을 향해 적천강은 씩 웃어 보였다.

“이제 시작이니라.”

# Chapter 201

“It’s been hard to catch sight of you lately.”

“Tell me about it. These days, I can’t tell whether I’m a bodyguard or a chief steward.”

At Wipeng’s complaint, Jin Wikyung let out a quiet laugh.

“Bear with it for a few more days. More importantly, how did the matters we discussed last time turn out?”

“Everything is proceeding smoothly. The Sect Leaders we brought into the fold are obedient, and the local authorities and merchant world are actively cooperating.”

If the Jin Family of Taiyuan was a ship riding a favorable wind, Jin Wikyung was its seasoned captain.

Beginning with securing the loyalty of the smaller and mid-sized sects on the first day of the gathering, he had handled one major matter after another.

The Fire King was holding down the Murim side of things, while Prince Shangshan, a member of the imperial family, was holding down the authorities. As a result, there had been no trouble at all.

*As for the merchant world, there was never any question.*

Merchants were more sensitive to profit than anyone. Once they smelled money, it was only natural for them to come rushing in.

After quickly organizing his thoughts, Jin Wikyung asked Wipeng:

“What about the budget? How much do you think we’ll have left?”

“We’re short.”

“What?”

At Jin Wikyung’s startled expression, the corners of Wipeng’s mouth rose.

“I mean that we’re short on warehouses to store the wealth.”

“……Phew.”

“Two warehouses were already full two days ago. The wealth that came in after that is being stored in empty pavilions.”

Jin Wikyung released a sigh of relief and gave a quiet laugh.

“What a haul.”

“Great Hero Jeok’s announcement yesterday was decisive. It gave certainty to those who had still been wavering until the end.”

“They’re the real heavyweights.”

“Indeed.”

The wider a person’s connections, the more likely they were to get pricked by thorns.

The Jin Family of Taiyuan was clearly a goose laying golden eggs, but there were also powerful sects and great families—including the Zhongnan Sect—with which it had an uneasy relationship because of the Fire King.

“Seok Family Manor suddenly requesting a private meeting after remaining quiet all this time must be because of that.”

Seok Family Manor was one of the greatest merchant houses in the world.

The fact that they had stepped forward was proof of how certain they were of the Jin Family of Taiyuan’s potential.

“Isn’t weighing the situation their defining trait? Since they were late to the party, they’ll make up for it with a generous gift.”

“They should. Have them come in.”

“Yes, my lord.”

Not long after Wipeng left, a fleshy middle-aged man entered the office.

“Oh, my! Lesser Family Head! How long has it been?”

“It’s been a long time, Chief Ha.”

The middle-aged man was one of Seok Family Manor’s five Outer Stewards. Though he was only one of five, the authority he possessed was immense.

Jin Wikyung smiled gently at the man, who kept wiping away his sweat.

“It’s been three years since we last met. How is your Lord?”

“He’s as hale and hearty as a young man in his prime. As it happens, he heard the happy news this time and wishes to meet you. As you know, Lesser Family Head, he wasn’t feeling well the last time……”

“Yes, I remember. Quite clearly.”

Jin Wikyung remembered that day three years ago as though it had happened yesterday.

He had waited a full fifteen days before being granted a private audience, only to leave Seok Family Manor as though he had been chased out without ever seeing the Lord’s face.

Finding the sedan chair of a high-ranking official in front of Seok Family Manor’s main gate had been a coincidence.

That was what he had chosen to believe.

*That’s how the Murim works.*

But now, their positions had changed.

The past three years had been short but eventful, and the arrogant Outer Steward who had treated him like a beggar had somehow become a humble merchant.

*I didn’t know this man even knew how to use honorifics. That’s a first.*

With a strange sense of amusement, Jin Wikyung listened carefully to Chief Ha.

He readily accepted Seok Family Manor’s proposal to enter the Shanxi merchant world in earnest with the Jin Family of Taiyuan’s cooperation.

Naturally, the details would need to be reviewed, but Seok Family Manor’s offer was extraordinarily generous.

“You’ve made a better offer than I expected. Generous enough to make me wonder whether this is really all right.”

Chief Ha rubbed his hands together and laughed.

“I’m a merchant to the bone. I never conduct business at a loss.”

There were different levels among merchants.

A Third Rate merchant exchanged goods. A Second Rate merchant purchased goods that could leave him a profit. A First Rate merchant bought the future.

Seok Family Manor was one of the greatest merchant houses in the world. They were aiming not for an immediate profit, but for dozens of times that profit in the years to come.

*You won’t make that much off us. Our family will never dance to your tune.*

Unlike his thoughts, Jin Wikyung smiled broadly.

Life in this world was not easy enough to reveal one’s true feelings and say everything one wanted to say. That was even more true with a cunning merchant.

“I’ll arrange a place for you to stay. We can discuss the finer details then.”

“Thank you, Lesser Family Head.”

Chief Ha was about to rise from his seat when he stopped.

“Um……”

“Do you have another matter to discuss?”

“This is a difficult request, but might I be allowed to meet Great Hero Jeok?”

The Outer Steward of Seok Family Manor was a man of considerable authority, but the Fire King was an exception. Since he had begun staying at the Jin Family of Taiyuan, Jeok Cheongang had permitted none of the honored guests to meet him privately.

Chief Ha continued, wiping away his sweat.

“It’s been extraordinarily difficult. I tried going to him myself, and I even sent my subordinates to discreetly request a meeting, but……”

“Oh, dear. Great Hero Jeok probably didn’t take that well.”

“No. My subordinate came back nearly crippled. That’s why I’m shamelessly asking you for a favor, Lesser Family Head.”

Suppressing his laughter, Jin Wikyung answered:

“Well, I can’t say for certain. It might be possible after the gathering ends, but it will be difficult over the next few days.”

“I noticed he hasn’t been seen since yesterday. May I ask why?”

“He must be instructing my youngest brother.”

“Ah, I see. My apologies for intruding.”

As soon as Chief Ha left the office, Jin Wikyung could no longer hold back his laughter.

The fatigue in both his body and mind from hosting the gathering for several days seemed to lift all at once. In a cheerful voice, he called for his most trusted subordinate.

“Wipeng. Who’s next?”

* * *

Before dawn, before the sun had even risen.

The person who woke me was neither Hyuk Mujin nor Cheongpung.

Splaash!

“Gah!”

The first thing I saw after opening my eyes to the cold-water ambush was Jeok Cheongang, glaring at me with his eyes wide open.

“W-What are you doing?”

“You slept like the dead until this hour. Are you out of your mind?”

“I only slept for two shichen.[^1] What do you mean, I slept until this hour?”

Jeok Cheongang started lecturing me as I stared at him in disbelief.

“In four hours, you bastard, this old man could swing a weapon a thousand more times. And where did you learn the disrespect of not even paying your morning respects to your Master?”

“……Master?”

Jeok Cheongang flinched and stammered for a moment.

“W-We need to look that way to other people, don’t we?”

“……”

“To avoid suspicion, we need to act like a real master! Like a real Disciple! That’s the bare minimum!”

“Ah, yes.”

So the pioneer of method acting in the Murim was right here.

At my lukewarm response, Jeok Cheongang’s face grew bright red.

“Regardless, I won’t stand for you loafing around like this. Come with me. Now.”

“Where?”

“There’s a place this old man has picked out.”

I thought he had found a secluded training ground, but the place Jeok Cheongang took me was not inside the Jin Family of Taiyuan. It was a nearby mountain.

Trees with trunks easily several meters around grew thickly in every direction, and the ground was firm.

“This will do.”

Jeok Cheongang stopped in a wide clearing and placed the pack on his back atop a tree stump.

“What’s that?”

“Don’t worry about it. It’s something we’ll use later.”

“Later?”

“Yes. They’re things that will make you writhe with pleasure.”

“……”

Why was I suddenly thinking of whips, candlesticks, and masks?

As I cast anxious sidelong glances at the pack, Jeok Cheongang spoke with a stern expression.

“Stop taking an unnecessary interest in it and take out your spear.”

“Ah, yes.”

I’d had the good sense to bring several spears along, and I planted them in the ground.

The reason Jeok Cheongang had come to find me so early was obvious.

*Training.*

Though he tried hard not to show it, Jeok Cheongang wanted to take me as his Disciple.

The reason he kept stubbornly denying it was that he still wasn’t certain himself.

*He’s already made one painful mistake.*

The emotional wound Jopil had inflicted on Jeok Cheongang had not yet healed.

That was why he would surely continue watching and thinking before deciding whether he could accept someone like me as his Disciple.

*Even if he doesn’t pass down the Fire Gate Clan’s supreme martial arts right away, he’ll still do his best to teach me.*

This was instruction from a Supreme Peak master.

A single word from someone who had gone farther ahead and conquered a longer path than I had was worth more than a thousand pieces of gold.

I lifted one of the well-balanced iron spears and swallowed.

“What do I do now?”

“Attack me.”

“Pardon?”

“I said attack me. With all your strength.”

A smile appeared around Jeok Cheongang’s wrinkled mouth.

“Thirty minutes. If you can make this old man retreat even one step, you win.”

Ding.

*Make him retreat one step?*

At first glance, it seemed easy, but there was a reason it was a Peak-Grade Quest.

Especially when the opponent was Fire King Jeok Cheongang.

I took my eyes off the Quest window and saw Jeok Cheongang standing there with a relaxed expression.

“All right. Begin.”

Beep.

> **System**

> **29:59**

At the instant the time-limit window appeared in the air, I kicked off the ground and charged toward him.

Whooosh!

* * *

Whoosh!

The spearhead tore through the air. Compressed air burst outward, sending the old man’s white hair flying.

Having dodged the first spear Jin Taekyung thrust at him, Jeok Cheongang thought:

*What is this kid?*

He was fast.

And the spear carried enough force to shatter a boulder.

Even for Jeok Cheongang, who had already examined Jin Taekyung’s body once, the speed and strength were beyond anything he had expected.

Whirl, whoosh! Boom!

Second strike, third, fourth……

He stabbed, slashed, and swept upward.

Every time Jeok Cheongang evaded the shower of spearheads pouring down like torrential rain, his astonishment grew like a snowball.

*He’s seasoned. As if he was born on a battlefield.*

He was only twenty-one. Yet the trajectories and movements traced by his spearhead were no worse than those of any famous master in the martial world.

No—if anything, they were better.

After encountering countless martial artists during the Great Faction War, Jeok Cheongang had learned something well.

*A true martial artist is forged through countless real battles.*

The Nine Sects and One Gang.

The Five Great Families.

They were certainly great powers that held sway over the world, but only a small number of their members had ever experienced surviving at the brink of death.

That was why the Demonic Cult, which had grown through conquest and the principle of Might Makes Right, had been able to swallow half the Central Plains.

How many disciples of prestigious great sects had died at the beginning of the war?

*But this kid is different.*

There was no hollow opening stance or hesitation.

The spearhead that relentlessly targeted the vital points throughout his body and the cold, hardened eyes were marks possessed only by someone who had experienced countless real battles and seen blood.

Shriiiik, whoosh!

The spinning spearhead vibrated.

Humm. Humm. Humm.

The sound was like hundreds of bees beating their wings, and the spearhead shooting toward him was sharper than a poisonous stinger.

*He’s only been practicing martial arts for three months? Someone like this?*

Judging by his movements alone, it seemed not three months but three years.

No—thirty years.

Jeok Cheongang knew nothing of Jin Taekyung’s battle-scarred seven years. All he could do was marvel.

*……What an incredible kid.*

Jeok Cheongang himself had spent his entire life obsessed with martial arts.

Yet even for someone who had achieved a great realm, what Jin Taekyung was displaying now was incomprehensible.

*The greatest martial talent in history, was it?*

Remembering Jin Wikyung’s words, Jeok Cheongang’s body trembled with joy and awe.

*Yes. You were right.*

It was then, as he slowly closed his eyes, savoring the lingering emotion.

Whoosh!

A streak of light shot toward his chest.

Jeok Cheongang’s eyes opened halfway. At the same time, his wrinkled hand seized the spearhead.

Crack!

His hands were already blazing with red flames. They crushed and melted the spearhead.

Molten metal dripped onto the ground, hardened by the cold wind.

“……Wow, shit. Isn’t that cheating?”

Jin Taekyung muttered in disbelief.

Jeok Cheongang grinned at him.

“Now we’re getting started.”
