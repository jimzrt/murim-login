흑석채의 산적들이 항복한 뒤, 가장 먼저 정신을 차린 것은 소국주 주화란이었다.

형용할 수 없는 눈빛으로 나를 바라보던 그녀가 깊이 포권지례를 취했다.

“큰 은혜를 입었습니다.”

“뭘요, 저도 겸사겸사 한 일인데.”

진심이다. 어차피 지나가던 길이었고, 시간도 얼마 걸리지 않았으니 레벨 업만으로도 충분히 만족한다.

물론 주화란 입장에서야 구원의 동아줄이었겠지만.

“진 소협의 도움이 아니었다면 저희 용봉표국은 이 자리에서 뼈를 묻어야 했을 겁니다. 산서잠룡의 위명은 익히 들었지만, 불의를 보면 참지 못하는 협객이라는 말이 사실이었군요.”

“협객은 무슨. 듣기 좋으라고 사람들이 퍼트린 소문이죠, 뭐.”

“네?”

“불의를 봐도 가끔은 참습니다. 거슬리는 놈만 가끔 치우고요. 그런데 어째 제 눈에 거슬리는 놈들은 항상 악질들이더라고요, 천력부 저놈처럼.”

어느 쟁자수의 손에 질질 끌려가는 천력부의 시신을 힐끗 바라본 내가 말을 이었다.

“그리고 우리 집안도 표국 하거든요.”

“아, 진가표국.”

과거 우씨 일가가 운영하던 성운표국은 진가표국으로 간판을 바꿔 달고 승승장구하는 중이다. 듣기로는 벌써 지부가 다섯 개를 넘었다던가?

섬서와 산서는 땅을 맞댄 곳이니 용봉표국과도 언젠간 인연이 닿겠지.

“진가표국 아시는구나. 언제 한번 마주치면 잘해 주세요. 오늘처럼 동업자 정신으로 서로 돕고 사는 거죠, 뭐.”

“동업자 정신이요?”

“무슨 문제라도?”

“혹시 진가표국과 저희 용봉표국이 경쟁 상대라는 걸 모르시는 건 아니죠?”

엥? 경쟁 상대였어?

나는 눈을 깜빡이며 되물었다.

“그게 사실입니까?”

“정말 모르셨던 거예요?”

“네. 아무래도 가문 쪽 일은 거의 신경 안 쓰다 보니.”

“아마 오늘 구해 주지 않았다면 진가표국이 섬서성까지 진출할 수 있었을 거예요. 지금은 이래 보여도 아직 섬서는 저희가 주름잡고 있거든요.”

“그렇구나.”

“보기보다 이 바닥이 좀, 치열해요. 보이지 않는 암투도 많이 일어나고 무력 충돌도 간간이 있죠.”

“뭐, 진출 못 하면 어떻습니까. 큰형한테 친하게 지내라고 말해 둘게요.”

묘한 표정으로 나를 물끄러미 바라보던 주화란이 풋, 하고 웃음을 터트렸다.

“그거 고맙네요.”

와, 순간 헉 소리 나올 뻔했다. 그냥 웃은 것뿐인데 뭐가 저렇게 예쁘지?

흘러나오려는 탄성을 꿀꺽 삼킨 그때, 등 뒤에서 수군거리는 목소리들이 들려왔다.

“세상에, 이소월 소저보다 아름다우신 분은 처음 보는데.”

“은비화 주화란은 강북삼화다. 이소월이 누군지는 모르겠지만 감히 어딜 비벼?”

“주제에 무슨. 궁 소협은 냇가 바위에 살이나 좀 비벼 보세요. 땟국물 진짜 더러워 죽겠네.”

“내가 뭐 어때서!”

“거지잖아요. 아닙니까?”

“하, 그건 맞긴 한데.”

천진난만한 목소리가 뒤를 이었다.

“아닌데. 이소월 소저도 예뻐요.”

“청 소협이 웬일입니까? 그런 말도 할 줄 알고.”

“그리고 제 눈에는 궁 소협도 예뻐요.”

“……그럼 예쁜 궁 소협이랑 같이 냇가 가서 씻고 오세요. 특히 눈을 집중적으로.”

볼 것도 없이 버뮤다 삼각지대다.

평소 같으면 소개라도 시켜 주겠는데, 대화 수준이 너무 낮아서 내 입으로 말하기도 민망할 정도다.

애써 헛기침만 내뱉던 그때 주화란이 내 어깨 너머로 고개를 쏙 내밀었다.

“저분들은 누구신가요?”

“모릅니다.”

“같이 오셨잖아요.”

“길동무예요.”

“정말요?”

“하늘에 맹세코.”

나름 목소리를 줄인다고 줄였는데, 기어코 대화를 들은 버뮤다 삼각지대는 들불처럼 일어났다.

“조장님! 저희가 부끄러우십니까!”

“내가 부끄러운가!”

“은인! 전 괜찮아요! 부끄러워해 주세요!”

“……사실 제 친구들입니다.”

“누가 봐도 그래 보여요.”

누가 봐도 그래 보인다니, 이건 이것대로 억장 무너지는 소린데.

내 표정에 피식 웃은 주화란이 세 녀석을 향해 포권지례를 올렸다.

“용봉표국의 소국주 주화란이 은인들을 뵙습니다.”

저 자식들이 뭐 했다고 은인 소리를 듣는지는 잘 모르겠지만, 어쨌든 버뮤다 삼각지대도 꾸벅 고개를 숙였다.

“대태원진가의 최정예, 진룡대 부대주이자 산서잠룡의 오른팔인 혁무진입니다.”

나는 침착한 목소리로 정정해 주었다.

“그냥 부대주가 아니라 임시 부대주고, 오른팔이 아니라 제 왼손 새끼손가락 같은 놈입니다.”

이어 궁기방이 입을 열었다.

“거지 궁기방이올시다.”

“차세대 거지 왕초입니다.”

마지막은 청풍.

“안녕하세요! 예뻐요!”

“보시다시피 애가 좀 아파요. 살짝 모자라긴 해도 착한 친굽니다.”

폭풍 같은 자기소개와 내 친절한 설명을 모두 들은 주화란의 입술이 살짝 벌어졌다.

큼지막한 검은 눈동자에서는 동공 지진이 일어나는 중이다.

“어, 이게 그러니까…… 왼손 새끼손가락, 차세대 거지 왕초. 살짝 모자라지만 착한 친구가 맞나요?”

“네, 정확합니다.”

“이런 설명은 난생처음 듣네요.”

“다시 말씀드릴까요?”

“아뇨.”

한숨을 푹 내쉰 그녀가 차례대로 한 사람씩 응시하며 입을 열었다.

“북방 마적단 토벌에서 상당한 공을 세운 쾌풍검(快風劍)에 관한 이야기는 저도 들어 본 바가 있습니다.”

“……어?”

혁무진이 얼떨떨한 표정으로 주화란을 바라봤다.

쾌풍검이라니, 도대체 언제 그런 별호를 얻었는지는 모르겠지만 반응을 보니 사실인 모양이다.

누가 뭐라 할 새도 없이 주화란의 말이 이어졌다.

“옆에 계신 분은 개방 방주 만리추행(萬里追行) 대협의 제자이신 후개 궁기방 소협이시고요.”

“바, 반갑소.”

“마지막으로 화산신룡(華山神龍) 청풍 소협을 뵙게 되어 영광입니다. 제 조부님과 아버님께서는 늘 검성 매종학 대협을 인의 대협이라 하셨지요.”

화산신룡은 성라대연 이후 사람들이 그에게 붙여 준 별호다.

청풍이 놀라서 눈을 동그랗게 떴다.

“와아, 그걸 다 어떻게 아세요?”

주화란이 싱긋 웃었다.

“용봉표국의 소국주니까요.”

짧지만 많은 의미가 담긴 대답이다.

우리가 하남을 떠난 시점은 성라대연이 끝난 지 며칠 되지 않은 어느 날.

‘정보를 수집하는 속도가 빠르다.’

더군다나 청풍이나 궁기방과는 달리 혁무진은 산서성에서만 활동한 신출내기 무인이다.

그럼에도 별호와 이름을 정확히 알고 있다는 것은 주화란이 생각 이상으로 치밀하고 명석한 사람이라는 뜻이다.

‘은비화(隱匕華). 비수를 숨긴 꽃.’

그녀가 숨긴 비수는 한 자루가 아니었다. 절정의 무공과 명석한 두뇌, 사람을 사로잡는 아름다운 용모까지 지녔으니까.

과연 무림 제일의 후기지수들이라는 십봉룡에 들고도 남았다.

‘신기하네. 이 정도면 표국도 잘 운영할 것 같은데.’

궁기방에게 들은 바로는 용봉표국의 지난 2년은 고난의 연속이었다고 했다.

나는 순간 머릿속에 든 의문을 훌훌 털어 버렸다.

‘에이, 신경 써 봤자 무슨 상관이라고.’

지금은 신의를 찾는 일이 더 급하다.

이미 한 시진 가까이 발이 묶인 상황, 동트기 전까지 목적지에 닿기 위해서는 지금부터라도 부지런히 달려야 한다.

“주 소저, 저희는 이만 가 봐야 할 것 같습니다.”

갑작스러운 내 말에 주화란이 멈칫했다.

“지금 말인가요?”

“급한 일이 있어서요.”

“이미 날이 깊었는데 여기서 하루 묵고 가시는 게…….”

“그건 좀…… 내일 중으로 서안(西安)에 가야 하거든요.”

“아.”

뭔가 할 말이 있는 듯 머뭇거리던 주화란이 입을 열었다.

“다음에 또 뵐 수 있을까요?”

“그럼요. 인연이 된다면.”

고개를 숙이고 돌아서려던 그때, 주화란의 목소리가 이어졌다.

“목숨을 구명해 주신 은혜, 절대 잊지 않을게요.”

“글쎄요. 굳이 제가 아니었어도 최악의 사태는 면했을 테니 그렇게까지 고마워하지 않으셔도 됩니다.”

“네?”

“물론 피해는 좀 있었겠지만요.”

아직 모르는 건가? 하긴, 그럴 수도 있지.

나는 어리둥절한 표정의 주화란을 향해 빙긋 웃어 보였다. 그리고 사나운 눈매의 젊은 표사를 힐끗 바라보고는 몸을 돌렸다.

‘역시 무림이 넓긴 넓구나. 저 정도 실력자가 표사라니.’

아까부터 시종일관 느껴진 시선의 주인이다.

덕분에 주화란과 대화를 나누는 내내 뒤통수가 따가워서 혼났지.

‘그런데 저 자식은 아까부터 왜 저렇게 노려보는 거야. 나랑 원수라도 졌나.’

곱지 않은 시선을 나만 느낀 것이 아니었나 보다. 내 등 뒤로 바짝 따라붙은 청풍이 속삭였다.

“은인, 은인도 느끼셨어요?”

“응. 왜 저러는지는 모르겠지만 엄청 노골적인데.”

“그렇죠? 은인한테 관심 있나 봐요.”

“…….”

제발 개소리 좀 하지 마.

네 사람의 신형이 바람처럼 쏘아졌다. 멀어지는 뒷모습을 바라보고 있던 주화란에게 한 사람이 다가왔다.

“화란아.”

“아, 허 숙부.”

산적들의 포박 및 뒷수습을 끝마치고 온 허준이 주화란의 시선을 쫒아 고개를 돌렸다.

“산서잠룡 진태경. 실로 대단한 젊은이다. 다른 이들도 마찬가지고.”

“그러게요. 강호의 소문은 믿을 것이 못 된다는데…… 이번만큼은 오히려 축소된 것 같네요.”

주화란은 진태경이 보인 무위를 떠올렸다.

그것은 실로 압도적인 광경이었다. 그런 그를 보며 전율했고, 한편으로는 씁쓸했다.

‘내게도 저런 힘이 있었다면.’

그렇다면 용봉표국이 작금의 상황까지 오지 않았을 텐데.

혀끝에서 맴도는 한 마디를 삼킨 주화란이 문득 입을 열었다. 그것은 공력을 실어 보내는 전음(傳音)이었다.

- 허 숙부. 송 표두를 주시하세요.

허준은 잔뼈 굵은 총 표두답게 노련했다. 아무런 내색 없이 다른 화제를 꺼내며 전음에 답했다.

- 화란아. 그 말은 혹시?

- 아직은 짐작일 뿐입니다. 하지만 걸리는 점이 한두 가지가 아니에요.

천년설삼에 관한 기밀 유출부터 지난 넉 달간 끊임없이 이어진 습격까지.

주화란은 내부 깊숙이 자란 배신의 싹을 도려낼 생각이었다.

‘특히 진 소협이 마지막으로 했던 말이 마음에 걸려.’

자신이 없었어도 최악의 상황은 오지 않았을 거라는 말.

그건 천력부를 가볍게 꺾고 적들을 상대할 고수가 용봉표국 내에 있다는 뜻이다.

‘그리고…… 그 눈빛.’

찰나에 불과했지만, 똑똑히 보았다.

돌아서는 진태경의 시선이 송일섬에게 머무른 것을.

그리고 은은한 놀라움이 담긴 그의 눈빛을.

‘분명히 뭔가 있어.’

주화란은 문득 지난 이 년의 세월을 떠올렸다. 약관도 되지 않은 어린 나이에 표국을 이끌며 겪었던 수많은 실패들.

그 실패의 원인이 사람을 너무 믿어서였다면, 누군가의 배신 때문이었다면 어떻게 해야 할까.

휘이이이잉.

휘몰아치는 찬바람을 받으며, 주화란은 한참을 그렇게 서 있었다.

“조용한 방 하나를 내주시겠습니까?”

백의(白衣)를 걸친 사내였다. 용모는 헌앙했고 언행은 듣는 이로 하여금 거절할 마음을 품을 수 없을 만큼 정중했다.

한 마리의 고고한 학을 연상시키는 그의 모습에 입구를 지키던 호위장은 내심 의문을 품었다.

‘누구지? 처음 보는 얼굴인데.’

호위장이 지키는 서안루(西安樓)는 그 이름처럼 서안을 대표하는 기루였다.

이곳에 묵기 위해선 돈뿐만 아니라 그에 걸맞은 지위가 있어야 한다. 그렇다 보니 매번 보는 얼굴들은 정해져 있었다.

‘마차도, 하인도 없이 혼자 온 청년이라…….’

원래대로라면 볼 것도 없이 퇴짜다.

하지만 이상하게 마음이 걸렸다. 굳이 수하들을 물리고 직접 그를 맞이한 것도 그 때문이었다.

“저희 기루를 방문하신 적이 있으신지요?”

“없습니다. 사치를 부리기에는 형편이 좋지 않아서요.”

청년이 쑥스럽게 웃으며 볼을 문지른 그 순간, 호위장이 눈을 부릅떴다.

‘저건!’

청년의 새하얀 옷소매에 수놓아진 연홍빛 꽃송이.

그것은 분명 흐드러지게 핀 매화였다.

호위장의 입술 사이로 더듬거리는 목소리가 흘러나왔다.

“호, 혹시 손님의 존함을 여쭤봐도 되겠습니까?”

“백 씨 성에 무성이라는 이름을 쓰는 도사입니다.”

“화, 화산일학!”

화산파 장문인 천검진인의 적전 제자, 화산일학 백무성이 빙긋 웃었다.

# Chapter 312

After the bandits of Black Stone Stronghold surrendered, the first person to collect herself was Ju Hwaran, the Young Bureau Head.

She looked at me with indescribable emotion in her eyes before performing a deep fist-and-palm salute.

“Thank you for the immense favor you’ve done us.”

“It was nothing. I happened to be passing by, so I took care of it while I was at it.”

I meant it. I had been passing through anyway, and it hadn’t taken much time, so the Levels I gained were more than enough compensation.

From Ju Hwaran’s perspective, though, I must have been a lifeline.

“If not for Young Hero Jin’s help, the Yongbong Escort Bureau would have been buried here. I had heard plenty about the Sleeping Dragon of Shanxi, but it seems the stories about you being a hero who cannot stand by in the face of injustice were true.”

“A hero? Hardly. It’s just a rumor people spread because it sounds good.”

“Pardon?”

“I can ignore injustice sometimes. I only occasionally get rid of people who annoy me. The problem is, the people who annoy me always seem to be scumbags—like that Heavenly Axe bastard.”

I glanced toward Heavenly Axe’s corpse as a caravan porter dragged it away, then continued.

“And my family runs an Escort Bureau too.”

“Ah, the Jin Family Escort Bureau.”

The Seongun Escort Bureau, once run by the Woo family, had changed its sign to the Jin Family Escort Bureau and was thriving. I had heard it already had more than five branches.

Shaanxi and Shanxi shared a border, so the Jin Family Escort Bureau and the Yongbong Escort Bureau would probably cross paths someday.

“You know about the Jin Family Escort Bureau. If you ever run into them, please treat them well. We should help each other out in the spirit of fellow business owners, just like today.”

“The spirit of fellow business owners?”

“Is there a problem?”

“You do know that the Jin Family Escort Bureau and the Yongbong Escort Bureau are competitors, right?”

*Huh? We were competitors?*

I blinked and asked again.

“Is that true?”

“You really didn’t know?”

“No. I barely pay attention to family matters.”

“If you hadn’t saved us today, the Jin Family Escort Bureau might have expanded into Shaanxi Province. It may not look that way right now, but we still dominate Shaanxi.”

“I see.”

“This line of work is more cutthroat than it looks. There are plenty of invisible power struggles, and armed conflicts break out from time to time too.”

“Well, what does it matter if we can’t expand? I’ll tell my eldest brother we should get along.”

Ju Hwaran stared at me with a strange expression before letting out a quiet laugh.

“I’d appreciate that.”

*Wow. I almost let out an actual gasp.*

She had only laughed. So why was it that beautiful?

I swallowed the exclamation that was about to escape when murmuring voices reached me from behind.

“My word. That’s the first woman I’ve seen who’s more beautiful than Young Lady Lee Seowol.”

“Dagger Hidden Flower Ju Hwaran is one of the Three Flowers of Jiangbei. I don’t know who Lee Seowol is, but how dare she compare herself to her?”

“As if she could. Young Hero Gung, go rub yourself against a rock in the stream and wash up. That grime is so filthy it makes me sick.”

“What’s wrong with me?”

“You’re a beggar, aren’t you?”

“Hah. That’s true, I suppose.”

An innocent voice followed.

“That’s not true. Young Lady Lee Seowol is pretty too.”

“What’s gotten into Young Hero Cheongpung? I didn’t know you could say things like that.”

“And Young Hero Gung is pretty too, in my eyes.”

“……Then go down to the stream and wash up with pretty Young Hero Gung. Especially your eyes.”

There was no question about it. They were the Bermuda Triangle.

Normally, I would have at least introduced them, but the level of their conversation was so low that I was embarrassed to say anything myself.

I was forcing out an awkward cough when Ju Hwaran poked her head out over my shoulder.

“Who are those people?”

“I don’t know.”

“You came here together.”

“They’re traveling companions.”

“Really?”

“I swear it on the heavens.”

I had lowered my voice as much as I could, but the Bermuda Triangle had inevitably heard me. Their outrage rose like wildfire.

“Captain! Are you ashamed of us?”

“Am I embarrassing?”

“Benefactor! I’m fine! Please be ashamed of me!”

“……They’re actually my friends.”

“Anyone can see that.”

*Anyone can see that? That was somehow even more devastating.*

Ju Hwaran gave a small laugh at my expression and performed a fist-and-palm salute toward the three of them.

“Ju Hwaran, Young Bureau Head of the Yongbong Escort Bureau, pays her respects to the Benefactors.”

I wasn’t sure what those three had done to deserve being called Benefactors, but the Bermuda Triangle bowed their heads anyway.

“I am Hyuk Mujin, one of the great Jin Family of Taiyuan’s foremost elites, Vice Squad Leader of the Jin Dragon Squad, and the right-hand man of the Sleeping Dragon of Shanxi.”

I calmly corrected him.

“Not the Vice Squad Leader. The acting Vice Squad Leader. And not my right hand. He’s more like the pinky of my left hand.”

Gung Gibang spoke next.

“I am the beggar Gung Gibang.”

“He’s the next-generation beggar boss.”

Finally, it was Cheongpung’s turn.

“Hello! You’re pretty!”

“As you can see, he’s a little unwell. He’s not the sharpest, but he’s a good friend.”

After hearing the storm of introductions and my kind explanations, Ju Hwaran’s lips parted slightly.

Her large black eyes trembled visibly.

“So, let me get this straight…… The pinky of your left hand, the next-generation beggar boss, and the slightly dim but kind friend?”

“Yes, exactly.”

“I’ve never heard an explanation like that before.”

“Would you like me to repeat it?”

“No, thank you.”

She let out a deep sigh, then looked at each of them in turn.

“I’ve heard of the Swift Wind Sword, who rendered distinguished service during the suppression of the mounted bandits in the north.”

“……Huh?”

Hyuk Mujin stared at Ju Hwaran with a bewildered expression.

*Swift Wind Sword?*

I had no idea when he had acquired such a sobriquet, but judging by his reaction, it seemed to be genuine.

Before anyone could say anything, Ju Hwaran continued.

“And the person beside him is Young Hero Gung Gibang, the Successor Beggar and Disciple of Great Hero Myriad-Mile Pursuit, the Beggars’ Sect Leader.”

“P-Pleased to meet you.”

“Lastly, it is an honor to meet Young Hero Cheongpung, the Huashan Divine Dragon. My grandfather and father have always referred to Great Hero Mae Jonghak, the Sword Saint, as a hero of benevolence and righteousness.”

The title Huashan Divine Dragon had been given to Cheongpung after the Star-Array Grand Banquet.

Cheongpung’s eyes opened wide in surprise.

“Wow! How do you know all that?”

Ju Hwaran smiled brightly.

“Because I’m the Young Bureau Head of the Yongbong Escort Bureau.”

It was a short answer, but it carried a great deal of meaning.

We had left Henan only a few days after the Star-Array Grand Banquet ended.

*She gathers information quickly.*

Unlike Cheongpung and Gung Gibang, Hyuk Mujin was merely a newcomer who had operated only in Shanxi Province.

The fact that she knew both his name and his sobriquet so precisely meant that Ju Hwaran was even more meticulous and clever than I had expected.

*Dagger Hidden Flower. A flower hiding a dagger.*

The dagger she concealed was not merely one.

She possessed Peak-level martial arts, a sharp mind, and beautiful features capable of captivating people.

She more than deserved her place among the Ten Dragons and Phoenixes, said to be the greatest young prodigies in the martial world.

*Interesting. At this rate, she must be good at running an Escort Bureau too.*

According to what I had heard from Gung Gibang, the Yongbong Escort Bureau’s past two years had been one hardship after another.

I brushed the question from my mind.

*Eh, what difference does it make if I worry about it?*

Finding the Divine Physician was more urgent right now.

We had already lost nearly a shichen here. If we wanted to reach our destination before dawn, we needed to get moving.

“Young Lady Ju, I think we should be going now.”

Ju Hwaran flinched at my sudden words.

“Now?”

“I have something urgent to take care of.”

“It’s already quite late. Why don’t you stay here for the night and leave in the morning……?”

“That might be difficult…… We need to reach Xi’an by tomorrow.”

“Ah.”

Ju Hwaran hesitated as if she had something to say, then finally opened her mouth.

“Will I be able to see you again?”

“Of course. If fate brings us together.”

I was about to bow and turn away when Ju Hwaran’s voice followed me.

“I will never forget that you saved our lives.”

“I don’t know about that. Even if it hadn’t been me, you would have avoided the worst-case scenario, so you don’t have to be that grateful.”

“What?”

“Of course, you would have suffered some losses.”

*She still doesn’t know?*

Well, it was understandable.

I smiled at the bewildered Ju Hwaran. Then I glanced at the young escort with the fierce eyes before turning away.

> **System**
> **Level 110: Song Ilseom**

*The Murim really is a vast place. Someone with that level of skill is working as an escort?*

He was the owner of the gaze I had felt ever since we arrived.

Thanks to him, the back of my head had prickled the entire time I was speaking with Ju Hwaran.

*But why has that bastard been glaring at me like that? Did I somehow become his sworn enemy?*

Apparently, I wasn’t the only one who had noticed his hostile gaze. Cheongpung followed closely behind me and whispered.

“Benefactor, did you feel it too?”

“Yeah. I don’t know why he’s acting like that, but he’s being incredibly obvious.”

“Right? Maybe he’s interested in Benefactor.”

“……”

*Please stop talking bullshit.*

* * *

The four figures shot away like the wind. As Ju Hwaran watched their backs recede, someone approached her.

“Hwaran.”

“Ah, Uncle Heo.”

Heo Jun had finished binding the bandits and dealing with the aftermath. He followed Ju Hwaran’s gaze and turned his head.

“Jin Taekyung, the Sleeping Dragon of Shanxi. He truly is an extraordinary young man. The others are no different.”

“I know. They say the rumors of the martial world aren’t worth believing…… but in this case, they seem to have understated things.”

Ju Hwaran recalled the martial prowess Jin Taekyung had displayed.

It had been an overwhelming sight. She had thrilled at the spectacle, but at the same time, she had felt bitter.

*If only I had strength like that.*

If she had, the Yongbong Escort Bureau would never have ended up in its current state.

Ju Hwaran swallowed the words hovering at the tip of her tongue and suddenly opened her mouth. The words she sent carried her internal energy in Sound Transmission.

—Uncle Heo. Keep an eye on Escort Captain Song.

Heo Jun was seasoned enough to be the Chief Escort. Without revealing anything on his face, he brought up another subject and replied through Sound Transmission.

—Hwaran. Are you saying that…?

—It’s only a suspicion for now. But there are more than one or two things that bother me.

The leak of confidential information about the Thousand-Year Snow Ginseng. The attacks that had continued without pause for the past four months.

Ju Hwaran intended to cut out the roots of the betrayal that had grown deep within the bureau.

*Especially the last thing Young Hero Jin said.*

He had said that the worst-case scenario would not have occurred even if he had not been there.

That meant there was a master within the Yongbong Escort Bureau capable of easily defeating Heavenly Axe and handling the enemies.

*And…… that look in his eyes.*

It had lasted no more than an instant, but she had seen it clearly.

Jin Taekyung’s gaze had lingered on Song Ilseom as he turned away.

And there had been a faint trace of surprise in his eyes.

*There’s definitely something going on.*

Ju Hwaran suddenly thought back over the past two years—the countless failures she had endured while leading the Escort Bureau before she had even turned twenty.

If those failures had been caused by trusting people too much, if they had been caused by someone’s betrayal, what was she supposed to do?

*Whoosh……*

As the cold wind whipped around her, Ju Hwaran stood there for a long time.

* * *

“Could you provide me with a quiet room?”

The man was dressed in white. He was strikingly handsome, and his speech and conduct were so courteous that no one listening could bring themselves to refuse him.

The sight of him brought to mind a proud, solitary crane, and the head guard standing at the entrance found himself wondering.

*Who is he? I’ve never seen him before.*

Xi’an Tower was, as its name suggested, one of Xi’an’s foremost pleasure houses.

To stay there required not only money, but also a social position to match. As a result, the faces that appeared there regularly were always the same.

*But he’s a young man who came alone, without a carriage or servants……*

Under normal circumstances, he would have been turned away without a second thought.

Yet something about the man bothered him. That was why the head guard had dismissed his subordinates and come out to meet him personally.

“Have you visited our pleasure house before?”

“No. My circumstances aren’t good enough for luxuries.”

The young man gave an embarrassed smile and rubbed his cheek.

The head guard’s eyes widened.

*That’s……!*

Embroidered on the young man’s snow-white sleeve were pale crimson blossoms.

They were unmistakably plum blossoms in full bloom.

A stammering voice slipped between the head guard’s lips.

“M-May I ask your honored name?”

“I’m a Daoist named Baek Museong.”

“H-Huashan’s Lone Crane!”

Baek Museong, the direct Disciple of Huashan Sect Leader Heavenly Sword True Person, smiled faintly.
