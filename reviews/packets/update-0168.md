character without a listed profile. Filenames must be plain `.md` basenames.
`names` contains only newly required Korean-to-English rows; Korean keys must occur
in the source. `address_pairs` contains only newly required speaker→addressee rows;
each Korean key must occur in the source or already appear in the address ledger,

퀘스트



[불로초를 찾아서]

이것은 오직 전설로만 전해지는 영초입니다.

불로불사, 불로장생을 꿈꾸는 지배자들은 불로초를 찾기 위해 수많은 재물과 인력을 쏟아부었지만, 지금까지 그 누구도 발견하지 못했습니다.

그러나 당신의 남은 수명이 천 년쯤 된다면 도전해 보는 것도 나쁘지 않습니다.



등급 : ???

제한 : 진태경

임무 : 불로초 습득(미완료)

보상 : ???

실패 : ???





“안 해!”

삐빅.



- 퀘스트를 거절하셨습니다.



퀘스트 꼬라지 봐라. 오죽하면 퀘스트 등급도 물음표 처리가 되어 있을까.

‘뭐? 남은 수명이 천 년쯤 되면 도전해 보는 것도 나쁘지 않아?’

이게 말이야, 방구야.

내 어이없는 눈빛에 장태보가 수염을 쓰다듬었다.

“왜, 못 하겠나?”

“……이걸 도대체 어떻게 합니까?”

“그럼 관두게. 하수오는 돌려주고.”

장태보가 내 손에서 하수오를 휙 낚아채더니 아삭아삭 씹기 시작했다.

“어, 달다. 역시 오십 년 산이야.”

“…….”

“응? 자네들 아직도 거기 있나? 무슨 볼일이라도 있어?”

“아니, 어르신.”

“왜?”

“불로초를 구해 오라는 게 상식적으로 말이나 됩니까?”

“무림에서 상식을 따지는 놈은 오랜만에 보는군. 천년설삼도 있는데 불로초라고 없을까?”

“…….”

제법 그럴듯한데.

순간 설득당할 뻔했지만 다시 정신을 차렸다. 이 바늘도 안 들어갈 것 같은 노인네를 어떻게든 설득해야 한다.

“대신 필요하신 게 있다면 뭐든 구해 드리겠습니다. 불로초 같은 거 말고요.”

“정말인가?”

“그럼요. 정 안 되면 저희 가문의 힘을 총동원해서라도.”

“흠. 요새 태원진가의 위세가 대단하다는 건 나도 익히 들어 알고 있지.”

고개를 끄덕인 장태보가 입을 열었다.

“그럼 목이 마르니 공청석유(空靑石油) 한 병 구해 오게.”

“예?”

공청석유? 한 방울이면 일 갑자의 공력을 얻는다는 그거?

쌍욕이 튀어 나가려는 걸 간신히 참았다. 장태보가 실실 웃으며 말을 잇는다.

“만년한철로 병기를 만든다고 했지? 그럼 검갑도 좋은 걸 써야겠구먼. 내 듣자 하니 저 세상 끝에 용이 있다던데, 발톱 좀 뽑아 오게. 겸사겸사 여의주도 하나 챙겨 오고.”

띠링.



- 퀘스트, [공청석유, 용의 발톱, 여의주 구하기]가 생성되었습니다.



퀘스트를 수락하시겠습니까?

Y   /   N



……하겠냐?

속이 부글부글 끓어오르는 걸 느끼며 퀘스트창을 지웠다. 혁무진이 입을 가리고 소곤거렸다.

“노인네가 노망 난 것 같은데요?”

“다 들린다. 대가리에 피도 안 마른 놈이 못 하는 말이 없구나.”

장태보가 솥뚜껑만 한 주먹을 흔들던 그때, 청풍이 손을 번쩍 들고 외쳤다.

“저 찾으러 갈래요! 저 시켜 주세요!”

“뭐?”

“불로초! 공청석유! 용!”

드디어 이 구역의 미친놈이 나섰구나.

샛별처럼 반짝이는 눈빛과 열정으로 타오르는 몸짓. 청풍의 박력에 장태보가 흠칫 물러섰다.

“네놈은 누구냐?”

청풍이 씩씩하게 대답했다.

“저는 우리 할아버지 손잔데요!”

“네놈 조부님이 누군데?”

“우리 할아버지신데요!”

“……미친놈이로고.”

어서 와, 청풍은 처음이지?

고개를 절레절레 내젓는 장태보에게 슬쩍 한마디를 던졌다.

“혹시 매종학 대협을 아십니까?”

“내 비록 무인은 아니나, 일평생을 무림에 발을 담그고 있던 몸일세. 백정들도 아는 검성을 모르겠나?”

“저 친구가 그 검성이 직접 키우며 가르친 제자입니다.”

“뭐라! 그게 사실인가?”

“거짓말해서 뭐 하겠습니까? 그것도 검성씩이나 되는 분의 이름을 걸고.”

“허, 검성의 후인이란 말이지…….”

먹혔나? 원래 세상 어딜 가나 최고는 학연, 지연, 혈연이다.

무림에서 검성 매종학의 존재는 그 자체만으로도 존경과 경의의 대상.

사뭇 놀란 표정으로 청풍을 바라보던 장태보가 입을 열었다.

“그래서, 뭐 어쩌라고?”

“아…….”

“나는 화산파와는 아무 연관도 없어. 아니, 삼십여 년 전쯤에 현 화산파 장문인인 천검진인(天劍眞人)의 부탁으로 검을 만들어 준 적이 있긴 하군. 하지만 그뿐일세.”

단호한 목소리가 이어졌다.

“내 나이가 팔순이야. 이만하면 몸도 정정하고 모아 놓은 재산도 많지. 쇠를 주무르던 사람으로서도 천하에서 세 손가락 안에 들었다고 자부하네.”

“그래서 이렇게 부탁드리는 겁니다.”

“그래서 이렇게 거절하는 거네. 내가 할 만한 일은 다 끝났어. 검은 질리도록 만들어 봤고.”

“저는 창인데요.”

“아, 그랬던가?”

“예.”

“창이라면 손이 더 가겠군. 차라리 검이 나아.”

“어르신!”

나는 간절한 눈빛으로 정태보의 손을 붙잡았다.

“오랜만에 소일거리 하신다고 생각하시고 딱 한 번만 도와주시면 안 됩니까?”

“내가 언제 안 된다고 했나?”

“방금까지는 안 하신다면서요.”

정태보가 모질게 손을 뿌리쳤다.

“도와준다니까. 불로초 찾아오면.”

“아, 제발요.”

“겸사겸사 공청석유와 여의주도 챙겨 오고. 내 듣자 하니 용을 상대할 때는 꼬리를 피해 뒤로 돌아가서 목을 조르면 된다더군. 다치지 말라고 알려 주는 걸세.”

“……용이 무슨 사람입니까? 목을 졸라서 죽이게?”

“그럼 불알을 터트려.”

“암컷이면요?”

“다음 생에 만나세.”

오랜만에 만난 강적이다.

세월로 다져진 사람 엿 먹이는 화법에 주먹이 부르르 떨리고 뒷골이 당겼다.

“이러시깁니까?”

“이러기일세.”

“이렇게까지 하고 싶진 않았는데…….”

“씨부려 보게.”

“소문내 드려요? 여기 전 철기방주가 살고 있다고?”

말만 이렇게 하는 거지, 당연히 그럴 생각은 없다.

하지만 장태보는 귀찮게 만들어 주겠다는 내 말에도 씨익 웃었다.

“그럼 어쩔 수 없지. 온갖 날파리가 꼬이기 전에 철기방으로 돌아가는 수밖에.”

“엥?”

이게 아닌데. 그렇게 생각하던 그때 장태보가 물었다.

“내가 철기방으로 돌아가면 뭘 할 것 같나?”

“……저야 모르죠.”

“내 남은 인생을 바쳐 열 개의 병장기를 만들걸세. 그렇게 심혈을 기울여 만든 병기를 구파일방의 주인들에게 하나씩 나눠 주면서 태원진가에 대해 심도 깊은 대화도 나눌 생각일세. 특히 자네 이름이 많이 나올 거야.”

“무, 무슨 얘기를 하시려고.”

“그걸 상상에 맡기지. 아, 참고로 무인이란 무공의 높낮이에 상관없이 병장기에 목숨도 거는 자들이란 사실은 알고 있겠지? 내 약소한 부탁 정도는 쉽게 들어줄 게 분명해.”

“…….”

구파일방의 장문인들에게는 약소한 부탁이겠지만 나나 태원진가 입장에서는 전혀 약소하지 않을 거다.

그들 앞에서 몇 마디만 씹어 대도 평판 하락은 기본이요, 어쩌면 실질적인 압박이 가해질지도 모른다.

“자, 이제 나는 떠날 준비를 해야겠군. 보자, 뭘 챙겨야 하려나…….”

덥석. 짐을 싸기 위해 방으로 들어가려는 그의 손목을 붙잡았다. 장태보가 천연덕스럽게 묻는다.

“왜 이러나?”

나는 힘없이 고개를 떨궜다.

“그만하십쇼. 제가 졌습니다.”

“그것뿐인가?”

“까불어서 죄송합니다.”

“그리고?”

“여기 계신 것에 대해서는 일절 발설하지 않겠습니다.”

“이렇게 찾아온 걸로 봐서는 자네만 아는 사실이 아닐 텐데?”

“저희 큰형님께도 잘 말씀드리겠습니다.”

“틀림없겠지?”

“물론입니다.”

“음. 아주 싸가지 없는 놈은 아니로군.”

원하는 대답을 모두 얻었는지 흡족하게 웃는 장태보다.

지금까지 나보다 강한 적들을 물리쳐 왔지만 은퇴 후 한적한 노후 라이프를 즐기는 노인의 마음은 꺾지 못했다.

‘그럼 만년한철은 어디 가서 제련해야 하나.’

드디어 생애 처음으로 애병이라는 게 생기나 싶었는데…….

막막해진 심정으로 반쯤 씹히다가 버려진 하수오를 바라보던 그때였다.

“자네, 창을 만든다고 했나?”

“예?”

“귀먹었나? 뭘 자꾸 되물어?”

황급히 고개를 들자 퉁명스러운 얼굴의 장태보가 보였다. 그가 말을 이었다.

“뭐, 나보고 직접 만들라고 하면 당연히 거절이지만 소개 정도는 시켜 줄 수 있지.”

“혹시 제자라는 철기방주…….”

“그 자리가 그렇게 한가해 보이나? 그놈도 바빠. 자네 정도면 족히 수년은 기다려야 될 걸세.”

“헉, 몇 년씩이나요?”

“그럼 병기라는 것이 하루아침에 완성되는 줄 알았나? 나보다는 못해도 한 솜씨 하는 녀석이니 주문도 밀려 있을 게 뻔하지. 가려서 받아도 그 정도야.”

아무리 그래도 그렇지, 몇 년이라니.

예상치 못한 장기 프로젝트에 숨이 턱 막혔다.

“그, 그럼 어떡합니까?”

“어떡하긴 뭘 어떡하나? 내가 소개장이라도 써 줄 테니 가져가게. 명색이 사부 소개로 온 놈인데, 조금이라도 빨리 해 주겠지. 그놈이 창 하나는 기똥차게 만들거든.”

“오오. 오오오.”

“이번에 마적 놈들 때문에 마을이 어수선했는데, 그거 처리한 게 자네라고 들어서 특별히 해 주는 걸세. 거기, 지필묵 있나?”

갑자기 지목당한 혁무진이 얼떨떨한 얼굴로 대답했다.

“없습니다.”

“응. 딱 봐도 안 들고 다니게 생겼어. 그럼 옆에 자네는…….”

“쩝, 쩝쩝.”

저걸 지금 먹네.

객잔에서 싸 온 만두를 볼이 터져라 밀어 넣는 청풍의 모습에 장태보가 한숨을 내쉬었다.

“……만두 맛있나?”

“쩝쩝. 네.”

“매종학 대협이 말년에 이상한 놈을 하나 거뒀군. 그럼 여기서 잠깐 기다려 보게.”

늙으면 죽어야지, 요즘 젊은 놈들은 예의를 몰라요.

들으라는 듯이 꿍얼거린 장태보가 방 안에서 지필묵을 꺼내왔다.

“우선 병장기는 창이고…… 생각해 둔 형태나 무게. 뭐 그런 거 있나?”

“아, 넵.”

“읊어 보게.”

나는 7년간 창을 사용하며 충분히 손에 익은 무게와 형태를 상세하게 설명해 나갔다.

그럴 때마다 장태보는 말없이 고개를 끄덕이거나, 아니면 내게 더 적합한 창을 제작할 수 있는 첨언을 덧붙여 주었다.

‘확실히 전문가는 전문가네.’

60년 짬밥이 어딜 가는 게 아니구나.

슬쩍 내 몸을 훑어보더니 수정해야 할 사항이 줄줄 흘러나온다. 손의 크기, 팔다리의 길이를 귀신같이 때려 맞추더니 창대의 굵기나 형태를 조금씩 변경시켰다.

“자, 그리고 이게 마지막인데. 만년한철은 어디에 넣을 생각인가? 아무래도 창날이겠지?”

“……?”

“표정이 왜 그러나? 만년한철 갖고 있다면서? 안 섞으려고?”

“아뇨. 넣긴 할 건데…….”

“갖고 있는 양이 적나? 내 짐작으로는 열 냥 정도만 있어도 충분히 명창(名槍)이라 할 만한 물건이 나올 걸세. 가보로 물려 줘도 부끄럽지 않지.”

열 냥이면 어느 정도지? 아직 익숙하지 않은 무게 단위라 감이 안 잡힌다.

더듬거리는 내게 장태보의 호통이 날아들었다.

“아! 얼마나 넣을 거냐고!”

“그게. 잠시만요.”

백문이 불여일견이라고 했다. 직접 보여 주는 게 빠르겠지.

나는 행낭을 뒤지는 척 하면서 인벤토리에서 꺼낸 만년한철을 쓱 내밀었다.

“이 정도인데요.”

“…….”

“어르신?”

장태보는 대답하지 않았다. 어른 머리통보다 큰 만년한철을 한참 동안 뚫어져라 바라보던 그가, 잔뜩 쉰 목소리로 물었다.

“이게, 이게 전부 만년한철이라고?”

“네. 혹시 처음 보시는 건 아니죠?”

“이, 이럴 수가.”

주름진 손이 잘게 떨린다. 서늘함과 푸른빛이 감도는 만년한철을 육십 년 만에 만난 자식처럼 쓰다듬던 장태보의 눈에서 빛이 번쩍였다.

“내게 맡겨 주게.”

만사가 귀찮던 노인은 온데간데없다. 열정과 활기를 띤 목소리가 이어졌다.

“천하제일의 신병이기(神兵利器)를 만들어 주지.”

띠링.

Beep.

What the hell kind of quest was this? The Quest Grade had even been replaced with question marks.

*What? “If you have about a thousand years left to live, it might not be a bad idea to give it a try”?*

What kind of bullshit was that?

At my incredulous stare, Jang Taebo stroked his beard.

“What? Can’t you do it?”

“…How exactly am I supposed to do that?”

“Then forget it. Give me back the He Shou Wu.”

Jang Taebo snatched the He Shou Wu from my hand and began chewing it with a crisp crunch.

“Oh, it’s sweet. Just as you’d expect from one that’s grown for fifty years.”

“…”

“Hm? Are you all still standing there? Did you need something?”

“No, elder.”

“Why?”

“Is it really reasonable to ask someone to bring you the Herb of Eternal Youth?”

“It’s been a long time since I met someone who cared about common sense in the Murim. There’s Hundred-Year Snow Ginseng, so why wouldn’t there be an Herb of Eternal Youth?”

“…”

That sounded surprisingly plausible.

I almost let myself be persuaded, but I quickly came to my senses. Somehow, I had to convince this old man who looked like even a needle couldn’t get through him.

“If there’s something else you need, I’ll get it for you. Anything you want. Just not something like the Herb of Eternal Youth.”

“Really?”

“Of course. If necessary, I’ll mobilize the full strength of my family.”

“Hm. I’ve heard plenty about how impressive the Jin Family of Taiyuan’s influence has become these days.”

Jang Taebo nodded and opened his mouth.

“Then I’m thirsty. Bring me a bottle of gongcheong seokyu.[^1]”

“Pardon?”

Gongcheong seokyu? The stuff said to grant a jiazi of internal energy with a single drop?

I barely stopped myself from letting loose a stream of profanity. Jang Taebo continued with a sly grin.

“You said you wanted to make a weapon out of Ten-Thousand-Year Cold Iron, didn’t you? Then you’ll need a fine scabbard, too. I hear there’s a dragon at the end of the world. Pull out one of its claws and bring it back. And while you’re at it, bring me a dragon pearl, too.”

Ding.

> **System**
>
> Quest **Get Gongcheong Seokyu, a Dragon’s Claw, and a Dragon Pearl** has been created.
>
> **Would you like to accept the Quest?**
>
> **Y / N**

…Was I going to?

Feeling my insides boil, I closed the Quest window. Hyuk Mujin covered his mouth and whispered,

“I think the old man’s senile.”

“I can hear you. You wet-behind-the-ears brat has a lot to say.”

Just as Jang Taebo was waving a fist the size of a cast-iron pot, Cheongpung suddenly raised his hand and shouted,

“I’ll go find them! Let me do it!”

“What?”

“The Herb of Eternal Youth! Gongcheong seokyu! A dragon!”

At last, the neighborhood’s resident lunatic had stepped forward.

His eyes sparkled like morning stars, and his every gesture burned with enthusiasm. Jang Taebo flinched and took a step back from Cheongpung’s forcefulness.

“Who are you?”

Cheongpung answered energetically,

“I’m my grandpa’s grandson!”

“Who’s your grandfather?”

“My grandpa!”

“…What a lunatic.”

Welcome. First time dealing with Cheongpung?

As Jang Taebo shook his head from side to side, I casually added,

“Do you happen to know Great Hero Mae Jonghak?”

“Though I’m not a martial artist, I’ve spent my entire life with one foot in the Murim. Do you think I wouldn’t know the Sword Saint, whom even butchers have heard of?”

“That friend is the disciple personally raised and taught by the Sword Saint.”

“What? Is that true?”

“Why would I lie? Especially while staking the name of someone as distinguished as the Sword Saint?”

“Hah. So he’s the Sword Saint’s successor…”

Had that worked? No matter where you went in the world, connections were king: school ties, hometown ties, and blood ties.

In the Murim, the Sword Saint Mae Jonghak’s very existence was an object of respect and awe.

Jang Taebo stared at Cheongpung with clear surprise before opening his mouth.

“So what do you want me to do about it?”

“Ah…”

“I have nothing to do with Huashan. Well, I did make a sword at the request of the current Sect Leader of Huashan, Heavenly Sword True Person[^2], about thirty years ago. But that’s all.”

His firm voice continued.

“I’m eighty years old. I’m still in good health, and I’ve accumulated plenty of wealth. As someone who has worked with iron, I can proudly say that I’m among the top three in the world.”

“That’s why I’m asking you.”

“That’s why I’m refusing you. I’ve finished all the work I care to do. I’ve made swords until I’m sick of them.”

“I use a spear.”

“Oh, did you?”

“Yes.”

“If it’s a spear, it’ll require even more work. Swords are better.”

“Elder!”

I grabbed Jang Taebo’s hand with an earnest look.

“Couldn’t you think of it as a pastime after so long and help me just this once?”

“When did I say I wouldn’t?”

“You just said you wouldn’t.”

Jang Taebo roughly shook my hand away.

“I said I’d help you. If you bring me the Herb of Eternal Youth.”

“Oh, please.”

“Bring me the gongcheong seokyu and dragon pearl while you’re at it. I hear that when fighting a dragon, you should avoid its tail, circle around behind it, and choke its neck. I’m telling you so you don’t get hurt.”

“…A dragon isn’t a person. How am I supposed to kill it by choking it?”

“Then burst its balls.”

“What if it’s female?”

“See you in the next life.”

I had finally met a formidable opponent.

His way of screwing with people had been honed over decades. My fists trembled, and the back of my head throbbed.

“Are you really going to be like this?”

“That is precisely how I’m going to be.”

“I didn’t want to go this far…”

“Go on, spit it out.”

“Should I spread the word? That the former Guild Leader of the Ironcraft Guild lives here?”

I was only saying that. Obviously, I had no intention of doing it.

But Jang Taebo merely grinned at my threat to make his life difficult.

“Then I suppose I have no choice. I’ll have to return to the Ironcraft Guild before all sorts of gnats start swarming around.”

“Huh?”

This wasn’t how it was supposed to go. Just as I was thinking that, Jang Taebo asked,

“If I return to the Ironcraft Guild, what do you think I’ll do?”

“…How would I know?”

“I’ll devote the rest of my life to making ten weapons. Then I’ll distribute those weapons, each made with all my heart and soul, to the leaders of the Nine Sects and One Gang, while having in-depth conversations with them about the Jin Family of Taiyuan. Your name will come up quite a lot, especially.”

“W-What are you planning to tell them?”

“I’ll leave that to your imagination. Oh, and you do know that martial artists will stake their lives on their weapons regardless of the level of their martial arts, right? I’m sure they’ll be happy to grant a small request of mine.”

“…”

It might be a small request to the leaders of the Nine Sects and One Gang, but it was anything but small to me or the Jin Family of Taiyuan.

If he bad-mouthed us with even a few words in front of them, a hit to our reputation would be the least of it. We might even face real pressure from them.

“Well, I suppose I should start preparing to leave. Let’s see, what should I pack…?”

As he turned to go into his room to pack, I grabbed his wrist. Jang Taebo asked innocently,

“What is it?”

I lowered my head helplessly.

“Please stop. I admit defeat.”

“Is that all?”

“I’m sorry for acting cocky.”

“And?”

“I won’t tell anyone that you’re living here.”

“Given that you came looking for me like this, it can’t be something only you know, can it?”

“I’ll explain everything properly to my eldest brother, too.”

“You’re sure?”

“Of course.”

“Hm. You’re not completely ill-mannered, then.”

Having gotten every answer he wanted, Jang Taebo smiled with satisfaction.

I had defeated enemies stronger than me all this time, but I couldn’t break the will of an old man enjoying a quiet retirement.

*So where am I supposed to have the Ten-Thousand-Year Cold Iron forged?*

I’d finally thought I was about to have my first cherished weapon…

I was staring at the He Shou Wu Jang Taebo had half-chewed and abandoned, my spirits sinking, when he spoke.

“You said you were making a spear?”

“Pardon?”

“Are you deaf? Why do you keep asking me to repeat myself?”

I hurriedly raised my head and saw Jang Taebo’s gruff face. He continued,

“Well, if you ask me to make it myself, I’ll obviously refuse. But I can at least give you an introduction.”

“You mean the Guild Leader of the Ironcraft Guild, your disciple…”

“Do you think the Guild Leader has that much time on his hands? He’s busy, too. Someone of your standing will have to wait several years at the very least.”

“Several years?”

“What, did you think a weapon could be completed overnight? He’s not as good as me, but he has some skill of his own, so obviously his orders are backed up. Even if he picks and chooses what to accept, it still takes that long.”

Even so, several years?

The unexpected long-term project left me short of breath.

“T-Then what do I do?”

“What do you mean, what do you do? I’ll write you a letter of introduction. Take it with you. You’ll be going there with a recommendation from his master, so he’ll probably do it a little sooner. That fellow can make one hell of a spear.”

“Ooh. Ooooh.”

“The village was in an uproar because of those mounted bandits, and I heard you were the one who dealt with them. I’ll do this for you as a special favor. Do you have paper, ink, and a brush?”

Hyuk Mujin, suddenly singled out, answered with a bewildered expression,

“No.”

“Yeah. You don’t look like someone who carries them. Then you there…”

“Chomp, chomp, chomp.”

He’s eating that now?

Jang Taebo sighed at the sight of Cheongpung stuffing the dumplings we had bought at the inn into his cheeks until they looked ready to burst.

“…Are the dumplings good?”

“Chomp, chomp. Yes.”

“Mae Jonghak took in a strange one in his later years. Fine, wait here a moment.”

*When you’re old, you should just die. Young people these days have no manners.*

Jang Taebo muttered loudly enough for us to hear and returned from inside with paper, ink, and a brush.

“First, the weapon is a spear… Do you have any thoughts about its shape or weight?”

“Ah, yes.”

“Tell me.”

I began describing in detail the weight and shape that had become thoroughly familiar to me after using a spear for seven years.

Each time, Jang Taebo either nodded silently or added advice on how to make a spear better suited to me.

*He really is an expert.*

Sixty years in the trade had not gone to waste.

He took a quick look over my body, then reeled off one correction after another. He somehow estimated the size of my hands and the length of my arms and legs, then adjusted the thickness and shape of the spear shaft little by little.

“All right, this is the last thing. Where are you planning to put the Ten-Thousand-Year Cold Iron? In the spearhead, presumably?”

“…?”

“Why are you making that face? You said you had Ten-Thousand-Year Cold Iron. You’re not planning to leave it out, are you?”

“No, I’m going to use it…”

“Do you not have much? In my estimation, ten nyang should be enough to make something worthy of being called a renowned spear. It wouldn’t be embarrassing to pass down as a family heirloom.”

How much was ten nyang? I still wasn’t used to the unit of weight, so I had no idea.

When I hesitated, Jang Taebo shouted,

“Ah! How much of it are you going to put in?”

“That’s… Just a moment.”

Seeing was believing. It would be faster to show him directly.

I pretended to rummage through my travel bag and casually held out the Ten-Thousand-Year Cold Iron I had taken from my Inventory.

“It’s about this much.”

“…”

“Elder?”

Jang Taebo didn’t answer. He stared intently at the Ten-Thousand-Year Cold Iron, which was larger than an adult’s head, for a long time before asking in an intensely hoarse voice,

“This… This is all Ten-Thousand-Year Cold Iron?”

“Yes. This isn’t your first time seeing it, is it?”

“I-I can’t believe this.”

His wrinkled hands trembled faintly. Jang Taebo stroked the cold, bluish Ten-Thousand-Year Cold Iron as though he had been reunited with a child after sixty years. A sharp light flashed in his eyes.

“Entrust it to me.”

The old man who had found everything a nuisance was nowhere to be seen. His voice was brimming with passion and vitality.

“I’ll make you the greatest divine weapon in the world.”

Ding.
