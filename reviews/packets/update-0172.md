적천강은 득의양양한 웃음을 머금었다.

‘흐흐, 뜨거운 맛 좀 봐라, 요놈아.’

그의 손가락 끝에는 극의에 다다른 열양지기가 실려 있었다.

삼성(三成)에 불과한 공력이지만 이제 고작 약관으로 보이는 햇병아리가 감당할 수준이 아니다.

‘이 정도면 정신이 번쩍 들겠지.’

어린놈을 괴롭히는 취미는 없지만 이놈은 혼쭐이 나야 한다.

아까부터 시수댐이니 뭐니, 당최 알아듣기 힘든 헛소리만 늘어놓는 통에 듣고 있기 힘들었다.

‘힘 조절을 했으니 잘만 하면 내상도 피할 수 있을 게다.’

잘만 하면. 적천강은 내심 한마디를 덧붙이며 손을 뻗었다.

톡. 깡마르고 주름진 손가락이 넓은 가슴에 닿은 그 순간, 해일처럼 밀려드는 극양의 기운에 진태경이 헛숨을 들이켰다.

“흐읍!”

“어떠냐, 속에서 불이 나는 것 같지?”

적천강은 얼굴이 벌겋게 달아오른 녀석을 보자 저절로 웃음이 나왔다. 역시 몽둥이가 약이라는 말은 만고불변의 진리다.

“자, 이제 헛소리는 그만하고 사실대로…….”

쐐애애애액! 쉭!

적천강의 말은 이어지지 못했다. 번개처럼 날아든 두 개의 검이 그의 허리와 팔을 베었기 때문이었다.

“어? 돼, 됐다! 청 소협, 성공이에요!”

얼떨떨한 표정으로 기뻐하는 혁무진과는 달리 청풍은 뒤통수를 긁적였다.

그의 눈앞에 피를 뿌리는 대신 안개처럼 흩어지는 적천강의 신형이 보였다.

“어어, 반박귀진(返璞歸眞)에 이형환위(移形換位)라…… 이거 단단히 잘못 걸린 것 같은데요.”

어느새 한참 떨어진 울타리에 걸터앉아 있던 적천강이 껄껄 웃었다.

“눈깔이 제법 쓸 만하구나.”

“어렸을 때부터 많이 보고 자랐거든요.”

“보고 자랐다?”

적천강은 그 말에 담긴 의미를 깨닫고 사뭇 놀랐다.

반박귀진, 이형환위. 모두 초절정의 강자에게만 허락된 영역이다. 그건 청풍의 주위에 그와 동등한 경지의 고수가 있었다는 뜻이다.

“네 사부가 누구냐?”

“저희 할아버지요.”

“말귀가 꽉 막힌 놈이로군. 네 할아비가 누구인지 노부가 어찌 알겠느냐?”

“할아버지가 말씀하시길 사내로 태어나 다른 사람 이름 뒤에 숨는 놈은 불알을 떼 버려야 한다고 하셨어요.”

“으하하하! 명언이로다!”

한바탕 웃음을 터트린 적천강이 청풍을 지긋이 바라봤다.

“내게 감히 검을 들이댄 죄, 감당할 수 있겠느냐?”

청풍이 곤란한 표정으로 입맛을 다셨다.

“그래도 검기는 안 썼으니 봐주시면 안 될까요?”

“썼다 한들 달라졌을까?”

“음. 그건 아니었을 것 같아요.”

적천강은 피식 웃었다. 어디 문하의 누구인지는 모르겠지만 재미있는 놈이 아닌가.

“하면 왜 나섰느냐?”

청풍이 망부석처럼 서 있는 진태경을 가리켰다.

온통 불그스름하게 달아오른 그의 전신에서 뜨거운 김이 모락모락 솟아나고 있었다.

“저분한테 신세 진 게 조금 있어서요. 할아버지께서 제 은인을 핍박하는데 가만히 있을 수야 있나요.”

“큰 신세를 졌나 보군. 목숨까지 걸 정도라면.”

청풍이 눈을 동그랗게 떴다.

“저를 죽이실 건가요?”

물론 이 자리의 누구도 죽일 생각은 없다. 그러나 적천강은 짐짓 얼굴을 굳히고 목소리를 내리깔았다.

“물론이다.”

“어어, 안 되는데. 아직 못 해 본 게 너무 많아요.”

“이곳은 무림이다. 노부가 그런 사정까지 봐줘야 할까?”

곰곰이 생각하던 청풍이 입을 열었다.

“그건 아니죠.”

조마조마한 심정으로 두 사람의 대화를 듣고 있던 혁무진이 발작했다.

“거기서 납득하면 안 되지, 이 인간아!”

“왜요?”

“저 늙은, 아니 저분이 우릴 죽일 거니까!”

“틀린 말은 아니잖아요. 음, 그리고…….”

청풍이 침착하게 한마디를 덧붙였다.

“죽을지 살지는 해봐야 아는 거고.”

“……젠장. 그래, 해봅시다. 어차피 가만히 있어 봤자 나중에 조장한테 맞아 죽을 텐데, 뭘.”

적천강은 턱을 괸 채 두 사람을 바라봤다.

역시 재미있는 놈들이다. 신세를 졌다고 목숨을 거는 놈도, 투덜거리면서도 결과가 뻔한 싸움에 나서는 놈도.

누군가는 객기라고 부르고, 누군가는 협의(俠義)라고 부르는 무언가가 저들에게는 있었다.

‘이런 녀석들은 꼭 일찍 죽기 마련이지.’

사십여 년 전에도 그랬고, 지금도 마찬가지일 것이다.

그렇기에 적천강은 이 어린놈들에게 약간이나마 호감이 생겼다. 그들에게는 최소한 다른 사람을 위해 자신의 목숨을 걸 만한 용기가 있었으니까.

바로 지금처럼.

“자, 그럼 한 수 가르쳐 줄까.”

적천강이 천천히 몸을 일으켰다. 그와 동시에 작달막한 체구에서 뿜어져 나온 산악과도 같은 기세가 사위를 짓눌렀다.

청풍과 혁무진이 검파를 움켜쥐었고, 장태보는 새하얗게 질린 얼굴로 털썩 주저앉았다.

“자네는 빠지시게.”

손을 까딱이자 장태보의 몸이 울타리 너머로 두둥실 날아간다. 마치 보이지 않는 손이 그를 잡아서 들어 올린 것 같았다.

그 광경에 청풍이 뇌까렸다.

“허공섭물(虛空攝物)…….”

어지간한 장정보다 큰 덩치의 장태보를 손짓 하나로 들어 올렸다.

그것은 눈앞의 노인이 자신의 조부에게도 뒤지지 않는 고강한 공력의 소유자라는 증거였다.

혁무진도 넋 나간 얼굴로 중얼거렸다.

“니미, 저건 소설에서나 보던 건데.”

차원이 다르다.

이 순간, 적천강을 둘러싼 모든 것이 그의 무기이며 방패였다. 주름진 입꼬리가 슬쩍 올라갔다.

“오거라.”

그 말이 신호였다. 청풍과 혁무진은 혼신의 힘을 다해 쇄도했다.

이미 수없이 많은 비무를 통해 서로의 무공에 대해 잘 아는 두 사람의 검이 정확히 맞물리며 합격술을 펼쳐 냈다.

쐐애애애액!

쉬쉬쉭!

두 개의 검신이 옆구리와 목을 파고들려던 찰나, 적천강이 두 손을 뻗었다.

어느새 백염(白炎)에 휩싸인 양손이 검신을 붙잡았다.

“그것으로 되겠느냐?”

그그그극.

혁무진은 눈을 부릅떴다. 그의 애검, 단단하기 이를 데 없는 백련정강으로 만든 검이 휘어지고 있었다. 그리고 이내 쇳물로 변해 뚝뚝 녹아내렸다.

“이게 무슨!”

혼신의 힘을 다한 일격이었지만 생채기 하나 내지 못했다.

이미 반쯤 녹아 버린 검신을 망연자실하게 바라보는 그의 귓가에 적천강의 목소리가 닿았다.

“용기는 가상했다. 그만 쉬어라.”

다음 순간, 혁무진의 눈앞이 새하얗게 물들었다. 가슴에 일장을 얻어맞은 그가 힘없이 무릎을 꿇었다.

청풍이 비명처럼 외쳤다.

“혁 소협!”

“걱정 말거라. 내상만 약간 입은 정도일 테니. 그건 그렇고…….”

적천강이 다른 한 손에 붙잡힌 청풍의 검신을 흘끗 바라봤다.

휘어지지도, 녹아내리지도 않은 그것은 은은한 자줏빛 검기에 휩싸여 있었다. 적천강은 오래전의 기억을 끄집어냈다.

“자하신공. 화산파의 문하였더냐?”

청풍은 대답 대신 일권을 내질렀다. 복호권, 호랑이를 굴복시킨다는 강맹한 권법이 적천강의 가슴을 후려쳤다.

퍽! 하는 소리와 함께 흰 눈썹이 반달처럼 휘어졌다.

“어쭈, 이놈 보게?”

가슴이 박살 나고도 남았을 만한 공격을 받고도 그 정도 반응이 전부다.

청풍은 마치 자신의 조부인 검성 매종학을 마주하고 있는 듯한 기분을 느꼈다.

‘강하다. 압도적으로.’

하지만 이대로 포기할 수 없다.

청풍은 길게 호흡을 내뱉으며 진각을 밟았다. 그의 전신에 일렁이는 자한신공의 기운이 한층 거세게 타올랐다.

“그래, 어디 한번 마음껏 날뛰어 보거라.”

적천강이 씩 웃으며 검신을 붙든 손아귀에 힘을 풀었다. 족쇄에서 풀려난 검이 매화검법의 절초를 쏟아 냈다.

쉬이이익!

유려하게 움직인 검 끝이 매화를 그려 낸다. 하나에서 둘, 둘에서 다섯, 다섯에서 아홉…….

마침내 완성된 스물네 송이의 매화가 빛줄기로 화해 적천강을 향해 쏟아져 내렸다.

이 순간만큼은 적천강도 진심으로 감탄하지 않을 수 없었다.

‘화산파에서 엄청난 물건이 나왔군.’

더불어 생각나는 한 사람이 있었다.

화산파의 상징이나 다름없는 존재. 아니, 천하의 모든 검객이 우러러보는 한 사람!

“매종학, 그 친구와는 어떤 관계냐?”

친구. 그 단어에 스물네 송이의 매화가 위태롭게 흔들렸다.

그리고 다음 순간, 아슬아슬하게 적천강을 비껴간 검기가 주위를 초토화시켰다.

콰과광!

자욱하게 피어오른 흙먼지를 한 움큼 삼킨 청풍이 기침했다.

“콜록콜록. 우리 할아버지를, 콜록! 아세요?”

적천강이 기껍게 웃었다.

“본 적이 있지. 아주 오래전에.”

자그마치 사십여 년 전의 일이다.

마교의 십만마도(十萬魔徒)는 천하의 절반을 집어삼켰고, 전황이 불리해지자 정파 무림은 심산유곡에 은거하던 기인들까지 찾아 나섰다.

검성 매종학이 구화산(九華山)을 찾은 것도 그때의 일이다.



‘도와주시오.’



그의 첫 마디였다.

적천강은 난생 처음 자신과 비견할 만한 강자의 방문에 놀랐지만, 대답은 이미 정해져 있었다.



‘싫소.’

‘천하가 위험에 처했는데도 말이오?’

‘말은 똑바로 합시다. 위험에 처한 건 당신네 정파 무림이지, 천하가 아니오.’



무림의 주인이 바뀐다 해도 세상은 변함없을 것이다. 정파에도 악인은 있고, 마교에도 선인은 있다.

그리고 적천강은 언제까지나 구화산에 남을 것이었다.

한참이나 생각에 잠겨 있던 매종학은 이마를 탁 쳤더랬다.



‘어, 생각해 보니 당신의 말이 맞구려.’

‘……나 설득하러 온 거 아니오?’

‘그건 그거고 이건 이거 아니겠소?’

‘이게 무슨…… 헛소리할 거면 그만 돌아가시오.’

‘그럼 이렇게 합시다. 무림의 법도를 따르기로.’

‘강자지존?’

‘내가 진다면 깨끗이 떠나겠소. 뿐만 아니라 영원히 당신의 존재를 불문에 부치지. 다만…….’

‘당신이 이긴다면, 내가 정파 무림을 도와야 한다는 거겠지.’

‘바로 그거요. 어쩌겠소?’

‘검을 뽑으시오.’



자그마치 칠 주야를 싸웠다.

그건 수백 년간 무림의 거목으로 뿌리내린 화산파와, 일인전승 비인부전의 원칙에 따라 이어진 열화문의 싸움이었고 두 무신(武神) 간의 혈투였다.

그리고 결과는 승자도, 패자도 없는 무승부였다.



‘안타깝군. 그런 무공을 갖고 있으면서 왜 이런 산골에 처박혀 있는 거요?’

‘남이사. 내 일인데 당신이 무슨 상관이오?’

‘어. 생각해 보니 당신 말이 맞구려.’

‘……듣다 보니 기 빨리는군. 이제 어쩔 거요?’

‘솔직히 계속하고 싶은 마음은 굴뚝같지만…… 이미 보름 전에 놈들이 감숙과 사천을 넘었소. 아쉽지만 이번에는 여기까지 합시다.’



적천강에게는 다행인 일이었다. 며칠만 싸움이 더 지속되었더라면 지는 것은 자신이었을 테니까.

매종학은 그보다 십 년은 젊었지만 이미 엄청난 강자였다.

고강한 공력이 없었다면 버티지 못했을 것이다.



‘곧 놈들이 이곳, 안휘성으로 올지 모르오. 몸조심하시구려.’

‘일 없소. 나는 구화산만 지키면 그만이오.’

‘어, 그러네.’

‘……제발 그만하고 가시오.’



검성 매종학은 그렇게 떠났고, 파도처럼 밀려든 마교의 군세가 안휘성을 넘었다. 그리고 보름 뒤, 구화산을 지나가던 마교도들은 중대한 실수를 저질렀다.



‘불을 질러라!’



구화산이 불탔고, 적천강은 세상에 나왔다.

천 명의 마교도 중 단 한 사람도 살아남지 못했다.

그리고 사람들은 그를 다른 이름으로 부르기 시작했다.

“그럼 할아버지께서……?”

# Chapter 172

Jeok Cheongang wore a smug grin.

*Heh heh. Have a taste of something hot, you little punk.*

His fingertips carried Scorching Yang Qi that had reached the pinnacle.

Though he was using only three-tenths of his internal energy, it was still far beyond what a fledgling who looked barely twenty could withstand.

*This ought to snap him back to his senses.*

Jeok Cheongang had no particular hobby of tormenting children, but this one needed to be taught a lesson.

All this time, the boy had been spouting incomprehensible nonsense about some “shisudaem” or whatever. It was hard to listen to.

*I’ve controlled my strength, so if things go well, he might even avoid an Internal Injury.*

If things went well.

Jeok Cheongang added that condition silently as he reached out.

*Tap.*

The instant his bony, wrinkled finger touched the young man’s broad chest, Extreme Yang Qi surged forward like a tidal wave. Jin Taekyung sucked in a startled breath.

“Hk!”

“How is it? Feels like there’s a fire burning inside you, doesn’t it?”

Jeok Cheongang could not help laughing when he saw the boy’s face turn bright red. The saying that a beating was the best medicine truly was an eternal truth.

“Now, stop talking nonsense and tell me the truth—”

*Whooosh! Shhk!*

Jeok Cheongang could not finish his sentence. Two swords had flashed in like lightning and slashed through his waist and arm.

“Did it work? It worked! Young Hero Cheong, you did it!”

Unlike Hyuk Mujin, who was celebrating with a dazed expression, Cheongpung merely scratched the back of his head.

Instead of blood spraying before his eyes, Jeok Cheongang’s figure scattered like mist.

“Uh… Returning to Simplicity and Shifting Form and Position… We seem to have picked the wrong fight.”

Jeok Cheongang was already sitting on a fence some distance away, laughing loudly.

“Your eyes are pretty useful.”

“I’ve seen a lot of things since I was little.”

“You grew up watching?”

Jeok Cheongang was genuinely surprised when he realized what those words implied.

Returning to Simplicity and Shifting Form and Position were both domains permitted only to Supreme Peak masters. That meant Cheongpung had grown up around someone who stood at the same realm stage as him.

“Who is your Master?”

“My grandfather.”

“What an obtuse brat. How would this old man know who your grandfather is?”

“My grandfather used to say that any man who hides behind someone else’s name after being born a man deserves to have his balls cut off.”

“Ha ha ha! What a splendid saying!”

After bursting into laughter, Jeok Cheongang fixed Cheongpung with a long look.

“Can you bear the punishment for daring to point a sword at this old man?”

Cheongpung licked his lips, looking troubled.

“But I didn’t use Sword Energy. Couldn’t you let it slide?”

“Would it have made a difference if you had?”

“Hmm. I don’t think so.”

Jeok Cheongang let out a quiet laugh. He did not know which sect or master the boy belonged to, but he was certainly an interesting one.

“Then why did you step forward?”

Cheongpung pointed at Jin Taekyung, who stood frozen like a monument.

Hot steam rose in wisps from his entire body, which had been heated to a reddish hue.

“I owe that gentleman a little. How could I just stand by while you bully my Benefactor, sir?”

“You must owe him quite a lot. Enough to risk your life, at least.”

Cheongpung’s eyes widened.

“Are you going to kill me?”

Of course, Jeok Cheongang had no intention of killing anyone here. But he deliberately hardened his expression and lowered his voice.

“Of course.”

“Uh-oh. That won’t do. There are still so many things I haven’t tried.”

“This is the Murim. Should this old man take circumstances like that into account?”

Cheongpung thought about it carefully before answering.

“I suppose not.”

Hyuk Mujin, who had been listening to their conversation with growing anxiety, suddenly exploded.

“You can’t just accept that, you idiot!”

“Why not?”

“Because that old man—no, that gentleman—is going to kill us!”

“He isn’t wrong. Hmm, and besides…”

Cheongpung calmly added,

“We won’t know whether we die or live until we try.”

“…Damn it. Fine, let’s do it. If we just sit here, Captain will beat us to death later anyway, so whatever.”

Jeok Cheongang rested his chin on his hand and gazed at the two young men.

They really were interesting.

One was willing to stake his life because he owed someone a debt. The other grumbled while stepping into a battle whose outcome was obvious.

There was something in them that some people called reckless bravado and others called chivalry.

*People like this always die young.*

That had been true forty years ago, and it would probably be true now as well.

That was why Jeok Cheongang had developed a faint fondness for the youngsters. At the very least, they possessed the courage to risk their lives for someone else.

Just as they were doing now.

“Then shall I teach you a thing or two?”

Jeok Cheongang slowly rose to his feet.

At the same time, an aura as vast as a mountain erupted from his short frame and pressed down on everything around him.

Cheongpung and Hyuk Mujin gripped their sword hilts, while Jang Taebo collapsed onto the ground with a deathly white face.

“You stay out of this.”

Jeok Cheongang flicked a finger.

Jang Taebo’s body floated over the fence as though an invisible hand had seized and lifted him.

Cheongpung muttered at the sight,

“Seizing an object through empty space…”

With a single gesture, the old man had lifted Jang Taebo, whose body was larger than that of most full-grown men.

It was proof that the old man before them possessed internal energy no weaker than his grandfather’s.

Hyuk Mujin also muttered with a vacant expression,

“Damn. That’s something you only ever see in novels.”

The difference in their levels was absolute.

At this moment, everything surrounding Jeok Cheongang was both his weapon and his shield. The corner of his wrinkled mouth rose slightly.

“Come.”

That was the signal.

Cheongpung and Hyuk Mujin charged with every ounce of strength they possessed.

The two knew each other’s martial arts intimately after countless duels. Their swords meshed perfectly as they unleashed a coordinated attack.

*Whooosh!*

*Shhk-shhk!*

Just as the two blades were about to pierce Jeok Cheongang’s flank and neck, he stretched out both hands.

His hands were suddenly engulfed in white flames as he caught the blades.

“Do you think that will be enough?”

*Grrrk.*

Hyuk Mujin’s eyes opened wide.

His beloved sword, forged from Baekryeon Jeonggang—the hardest steel imaginable—was bending. Then it turned into molten metal and began dripping away.

“What is this?”

He had put everything he had into that strike, yet he had not even managed to leave a scratch.

As he stared blankly at the blade, already half melted, Jeok Cheongang’s voice reached his ears.

“Your courage was admirable. Get some rest.”

The next moment, Hyuk Mujin’s vision turned white. A palm strike struck him in the chest, and he dropped helplessly to his knees.

“Young Hero Hyuk!”

“Don’t worry. He should have suffered no more than a minor Internal Injury. More importantly…”

Jeok Cheongang glanced at the blade held in his other hand.

It had neither bent nor melted. Instead, it was wrapped in a faint purple Sword Energy.

Jeok Cheongang dredged up a memory from long ago.

“Zaha Divine Technique. Are you a disciple of Huashan?”

Cheongpung answered by throwing a punch.

The Crouching Tiger Fist, a powerful fist technique said to subdue tigers, slammed into Jeok Cheongang’s chest.

*Thud!*

Jeok Cheongang’s white eyebrows curved like a crescent moon.

“Well, look at you.”

That attack would have been enough to shatter a person’s chest, yet that was the entirety of his reaction.

Cheongpung felt as though he were facing his grandfather, the Sword Saint Mae Jonghak.

*He’s strong. Overwhelmingly strong.*

But Cheongpung could not give up like this.

He exhaled slowly and stamped his foot into the ground. The Zaha Divine Technique’s energy rippling through his body flared even more fiercely.

“Go on, then. Let yourself run wild.”

Jeok Cheongang grinned and relaxed his grip on the blade.

Freed from its restraint, the sword unleashed the ultimate techniques of the Plum Blossom Sword Technique.

*Shiiiiing!*

The tip of the sword moved fluidly, drawing plum blossoms in the air.

One became two. Two became five. Five became nine…

At last, twenty-four fully formed plum blossoms transformed into streaks of light and poured down toward Jeok Cheongang.

At this moment, even Jeok Cheongang could not help feeling genuinely impressed.

*Huashan has produced an incredible talent.*

And that brought one person to mind.

A figure who was practically synonymous with Huashan.

No—a figure revered by every swordsman under heaven.

“Mae Jonghak—what is your relationship with that friend of mine?”

The twenty-four plum blossoms wavered dangerously at the word *friend*.

The next moment, the Sword Energy narrowly missed Jeok Cheongang and reduced the surrounding area to ruins.

*Kaboom!*

Cheongpung swallowed a mouthful of thickly rising dust and coughed.

“Cough, cough. Do you know my grandfather, cough?”

Jeok Cheongang laughed with evident pleasure.

“I’ve met him. A very long time ago.”

It had been more than forty years ago.

The Demonic Cult’s hundred thousand followers had devoured half the world. As the tide of war turned against the orthodox faction, the orthodox Murim began searching even for eccentric masters who had withdrawn into remote mountain valleys.

That was when the Sword Saint Mae Jonghak visited Mount Jiuhua.

“Help me.”

Those were his first words.

Jeok Cheongang was surprised by the visit of a master who could be compared to himself, but his answer had already been decided.

“No.”

“The world is in danger.”

“Let’s speak plainly. It’s your orthodox Murim that’s in danger, not the world.”

Even if the master of the Murim changed, the world itself would remain the same. There were villains in the orthodox faction and good people in the Demonic Cult.

And Jeok Cheongang intended to remain on Mount Jiuhua forever.

Mae Jonghak was lost in thought for a long while before suddenly tapping his forehead.

“Oh, now that I think about it, you’re right.”

“…You didn’t come here to persuade me?”

“That’s that, and this is this, isn’t it?”

“What kind of nonsense is that? If you’re going to keep talking rubbish, go home.”

“Then let’s do this. We’ll follow the law of the Murim.”

“Might makes right?”

“If I lose, I’ll leave without complaint. Not only that, I’ll keep your existence hidden from the Murim forever. However…”

“If you win, I have to help the orthodox Murim.”

“Exactly. What do you say?”

“Draw your sword.”

They fought for seven days and seven nights.

It was a battle between Huashan, which had taken root as a great tree of the Murim over hundreds of years, and the Fire Gate Clan, whose martial arts had been passed down according to the principles of one-man succession and secret transmission.

It was a bloody struggle between two Martial Gods.

And the result was a draw, with neither victor nor loser.

“What a pity. With martial arts like yours, why are you holed up in a mountain village like this?”

“Mind your own business. It’s my affair. What does it have to do with you?”

“Oh. Now that I think about it, you’re right.”

“…Listening to you is exhausting. What are you going to do now?”

“Honestly, I’d love to keep going, but… they crossed Gansu and Sichuan fifteen days ago. It’s a shame, but let’s leave it here this time.”

It had been fortunate for Jeok Cheongang.

If their battle had continued for even a few more days, he would have been the one to lose.

Mae Jonghak was ten years younger than him, yet he was already an astonishingly powerful master.

Without his own formidable internal energy, Jeok Cheongang would never have been able to endure.

“They may reach Anhui soon. Take care of yourself.”

“No problem. All I have to do is guard Mount Jiuhua.”

“Oh. That’s true.”

“…Please stop talking and go.”

The Sword Saint Mae Jonghak left just like that, and the Demonic Cult’s army surged forward like a wave and crossed into Anhui.

Fifteen days later, the Demonic Cultists passing through Mount Jiuhua made a grave mistake.

“Set it on fire!”

Mount Jiuhua burned, and Jeok Cheongang emerged into the world.

Not one of the thousand Demonic Cultists survived.

And people began calling him by another name.

“Then my grandfather…?”

Fire King Jeok Cheongang merely smiled faintly instead of answering.
