원단 첫날 열린 연회는 대성공이라는 말로도 부족했다.

진위경은 항산검문을 포용함으로써 수십 개 중소 문파의 충성을 받아 내는 파격적인 행보를 보여 줬고, 종남파의 개입과 이미 죽은 줄만 알았던 화왕 적천강의 등장은 모두를 충격에 빠트렸다.

그리고…….

‘그중에는 나도 있지.’

먹고, 마시고, 걸음을 옮기고. 내 일거수일투족마다 사람들의 시선이 따라붙는다.

반나절 전만 하더라도 그 시선들이 뜻하는 것은 ‘산서잠룡’에 대한 관심이었지만 이제는 아니었다.

‘화왕의 제자. 열화문의 계승자.’

곳곳에서 그런 말들이 흘러나오고 있었다. 열화문의 당대 문주인 적천강이 내게 문파의 신물을 넘긴 의미에 대해서, 종남파를 적대하면서까지 태원진가를 보호한 이유에 대해서 쉴 새 없이 떠들고 있다.

‘이거 어째 반쯤 사실로 굳혀진 것 같은데.’

사실 나도 적천강의 의중을 잘 모르겠다. 그래서 이 자리에 있는 거고.

사람들이 정신없는 틈을 타 슬쩍 빠져나온 지금이 바로 적기다.

“후우.”

크게 심호흡했다.

지금 내가 서 있는 곳은 적천강이 머물게 된 처소 앞이었다. 커다란 전각 근처에는 따로 명령이 내려졌는지 쥐 새끼 한 마리 얼씬거리지 않았다.

“적 대협. 계십니까?”

문 너머로 대답이 들려왔다.

“잔다.”

“여쭤볼 게 있어서 왔습니다.”

“잔다고.”

“……주무시는데 대답은 어떻게 하세요?”

“몽유병이니라.”

이게 말이여, 망아지여.

어이가 없었지만 화왕이 그렇다면 그런 거다. 나는 멘탈을 수습하고 다시 입을 열었다.

“저기, 아무리 생각해도 궁금한 게 있어서 말입니다.”

“노부가 네 녀석 궁금증 해결해 주는 사람이냐?”

“그건 아닌데요.”

“잘 알고 있으면 가서 발 닦고 잠이나 자거라.”

철벽 보소. 하지만 여기서 물러설 수는 없다.

굳게 닫힌 문을 향해 아주 조심스럽게, 살금살금 다가가던 그때였다.

“한 걸음만 더 내디디면 내일 뜨는 해를 못 볼 줄 알아라.”

“……어떻게 아셨어요?”

“네놈 인기척이나 천둥소리나 노부에게는 매한가지니까.”

“그러지 마시고 이제 들여보내 주시면 안 됩니까? 아직 겨울이라 날씨도 쌀쌀한데.”

“화염신장으로 뜨끈하게 덥혀 주랴?”

“…….”

거, 듣는 것만으로도 오장육부가 뜨끈해지네.

내가 입을 다물자 침묵이 흘렀다. 한동안 이어지던 고요를 깨트린 것은 적천강의 한마디였다.

“정양(定襄)에 다녀왔다.”

“아.”

보잘것없는 구슬 하나에도 누군가에게는 남다른 의미가 있는 법. 정양이 바로 그렇다.

산서성에 존재하는 수십 개 현읍 중 하나에 불과한 정양의 어느 산길에, 적천강은 가야 할 이유가 있었다.

‘조필.’

하늘이 눈을 펑펑 쏟아 내던 그날, 장천으로 살던 한 사내가 조필이라는 이름으로 죽었다.

“네게 들은 그 자리에서 한참을 머물렀다. 웬 노인이 산기슭을 서성거리니 지나가던 이들이 묻더구나. 왜 여기 있느냐고.”

가라앉은 목소리가 이어졌다.

“바로 이곳에서 피붙이가 죽었다고 대답했다. 남은 시신이라도 수습해 주고 싶어서 왔노라고.”

“…….”

“그때 깨달았다. 너보다 앞서 그 아이를 만났더라도 결코 죽이지 못했을 거라는 것을. 다시 놓아주고 후회했으리라는 것을 말이다.”

문 너머 적천강이 어떤 표정을 짓고 있을지 쉽게 짐작이 가질 않았다.

나는 망설이다 입을 열었다.

“시신은 찾았습니까?”

“아무것도 없었다.”

벌써 몇 달이 흘렀다.

지금까지 혈로(血路)만 걸어온 인생. 시신을 수습해 줄 수하들도 함께 죽었으니 변덕스러운 날씨에 파묻혔거나, 굶주린 짐승들의 먹이가 되었을 것이다.

“늙은이의 욕심이다. 추하고 부질없는.”

쪼르륵.

술잔을 채우는 소리가 유난히 크게 들렸다.

“아까는 취하셨다면서요?”

“영악한 놈. 다 알면서 묻기는.”

전각 안을 환하게 메운 촛불이 그의 인영을 비춘다.

피식, 소리 내어 웃음을 흘린 적천강이 술잔을 꺾었다.

“크. 좋다.”

한 잔 술에 시름을 털어 버린 듯 후련한 목소리다.

문득 적천강이 조필이 죽은 자리를 찾아간 것은, 아직 그를 붙잡고 있는 후회와 미련을 떨쳐 내기 위해서였을 거라는 생각이 들었다.

나는 애써 밝은 목소리로 말했다.

“좋은 건 나눠야 한다고 배웠습니다만.”

“난 어릴 때부터 남의 것을 탐하는 놈은 화염신장으로 지져 버려야 한다고 배웠다.”

“어느 무시무시한 분이 그런 말을 했습니까?”

“내 스승님.”

역시 볼케이노문이야. 가차 없지.

어떤 놈이건 간에 화염신장으로 죄다 지져 버리는구나.

열화문의 역사와 역대 문주가 누구인지는 모르지만 적천강을 보고 있자면 얼추 짐작이 간다.

‘역사 깊은 깡패 문파.’

콩 심은 데 콩 나고 팥 심은 데 팥 난다고 했다.

그 스승에 그 제자지 뭐. 물론 조필의 경우는 예외지만.

‘그나저나 이런 얘기를 하러 온 게 아닌데.’

말없이 술만 홀짝거리는 인영을 바라보며 눈치를 살피던 그때. 적천강이 불쑥 입을 열었다.

“앞으로 화천검(火天劍)은 네 것이다.”

“화, 뭐요?”

“화천검. 네 녀석에게 맡긴 검 말이다.”

[이름 없는 검]의 진짜 이름을 알게 됐지만 지금 그게 문제가 아니다. 나는 놀라서 말까지 더듬었다.

“하, 하지만 이건 열화문의 신물이잖아요.”

“아, 신물.”

몇 잔째인지 모를 술잔을 기울인 적천강이 말을 이었다.

“그거 거짓말이다.”

“예?”

“신물 아니라고. 백 년 전쯤인가, 본문의 문주였던 어느 분이 쓰시던 걸 후대가 물려받은 거지. 오래되긴 했지만 뭐, 당시에도 신병이기(神兵利器)라 불릴 정도였으니 아직 쓸 만할 게다.”

“……!”

아니, 이게 무슨 개소리야.

나는 생각지도 못한 충격적인 진실에 입을 딱 벌렸다.

“그게 다 거짓말이었다고요? 지금 저 놀리시는 거죠?”

“놀려? 너 같은 핏덩이를 뭣 하러?”

“사람들 앞에서 그러셨잖아요! 저놈에게 열화문의 신물을 맡겼다!”

“그랬지. 사람들 앞이니까.”

적천강이 심드렁한 목소리로 말을 이었다.

“그 정도는 해 줘야 세인들이 떠들 것 아니냐. 아, 저놈이 화왕과 깊은 연관이 있구나. 신물을 맡겼으니 제자가 아닐까. 태원진가를 건드리면 그 무시무시한 화왕이 나서겠구나. 뭐 그런 소문이 일파만파 퍼지겠지.”

“…….”

“설마 노부가 네 녀석 같은 애송이한테 본문의 신물을 맡기겠느냐? 어차피 일인전승이라 아는 사람도 없는데 내가 신물이라고 하면 그게 신물인 거지.”

“…….”

“그러니 검은 계속 갖고 있어라. 그래야 종남파 놈들이 감히 나서지 못할 테니.”

이거 꿈인가. 충격에 빠진 내 귓가로 확인 사살을 알리는 시스템 알림이 울렸다.

띠링.



- [이름 없는 검]에 관한 정보가 갱신되었습니다.



아이템창



[화천검]

종류 : 검

등급 : 절정

제한 : [열화문]의 진전을 이은 자

설명 : 열화문의 십 대 문주가 사용하던 애검. 만년한철로 제작되어 매우 날카롭고 단단하다. 오랜 세월 수많은 주인을 거치며 스스로 변화했다. 열화문의 진전을 이은 자만이 진정한 힘을 끌어낼 수 있다.

효과 : 알 수 없음





갱신된 정보는 적천강의 말 그대로였다. 십 대 문주가 사용하던 애검. 열화문의 신물이라는 말은 눈 씻고 찾아봐도 없다.

그나마 검에 숨겨져 있다는 ‘진정한 힘’조차도 열화문의 진전을 이어야 한단다.

한마디로 만년한철인 것을 빼면 시체라는 뜻.

‘난 진짜 신물인 줄 알았는데. 열화문의 제자로 삼겠다고 하면 어쩌나 엄청 고민했는데…….’

허탈하게 홀로그램 창을 바라보는 내게 적천강이 선심 쓰는 듯 덧붙였다.

“장기 대여라고 생각해라. 노부가 깜빡하고 그대로 죽어 버리면 가져도 좋다. 아, 화염신장의 비급은 지금 당장 뱉어 내고.”

“망할 늙은이…… 헉.”

생각만 한다는 게 그만 입 밖으로 튀어나와 버렸다.

화들짝 놀라 입을 다문 그 순간, 굳게 닫혀 있던 전각의 문이 그대로 터져 나갔다.

우지직!

화염이 이글거리는 한 쌍의 눈동자가 날 응시했다.

“이 핏덩이 같은 놈이. 방금 뭐라 했느냐?”

“마, 마, 말실수였는데요.”

“말실수? 그럼 노부도 손 실수 한 번 하마.”

후욱!

붉게 달아오른 손바닥과 압도적인 열기.

나는 뒤도 돌아보지 않고 몸을 돌렸다. 찰나의 순간 인벤토리에서 꺼낸 화염신장의 비급을 던지는 것도 잊지 않았다.

“헉, 비급, 화염신장의 비급이!”

그대로 손을 뻗었다가는 비급이 잿가루가 될 판.

대경한 적천강이 황급히 주먹을 거둬들인다. 나는 그 틈을 타 죽을힘을 다해 뛰었다.

“죄송합니다! 진짜 죄송해요! 살려 주세요!”

“이, 이 죽일 놈! 거기 안 서!”

등 뒤로 그의 고함이 쩌렁쩌렁 울렸다.



* * *



꽁지가 빠지도록 도망가는 진태경의 뒷모습을 바라보던 적천강이 피식 웃었다.

방금 전까지 얼굴에 가득하던 분노의 기색은 씻은 듯이 사라진 후였다.

“이놈아, 네가 아무리 도망쳐 봐야 노부의 손바닥 안이니라.”

잡으려 한다면 얼마든지 잡을 수 있다.

그러나 적천강은 뒷짐을 지고 돌아섰다.

자식처럼 아끼던 제자, 장천을 죽인 장본인이지만 진태경에 대한 증오는 없다. 오히려 적천강이 진심으로 사과해야 할 사람 중 하나다.

이 모든 것은 십 년 전, 그의 잘못된 선택으로부터 비롯되었으니까.

“망할 늙은이라고 했지.”

핏덩이 같은 어린놈에게 폭언을 들었음에도 기분이 나쁘지 않았다. 아니, 오히려 후련하기까지 했다.

“그렇지. 나야 말로 망할 늙은이고 노망난 늙은이지. 허허, 허허허.”

스승이 죽은 이후, 감히 어느 누구도 적천강의 면전에서 그를 비난하거나 욕하지 못했다.

그는 화왕이니까. 홀로 전설을 써 내려간 위대한 무인이니까.

그러던 차에 진태경의 한마디를 들으니 오랫동안 막혀 있던 뭔가가 뻥 뚫린 기분이다.

“시원하군. 시원해.”

하루하루 늙어 갈수록 사람은 외로워진다. 살을 맞댈 존재가 없어서가 아니라, 마음을 기댈 존재가 없기 때문이다.

누군가의 버팀목이 될 수는 있지만 누군가에게 기대기에는 너무 늙어 버렸다.

“누군가의 버팀목이라…….”

적천강은 거칠고 날카로운 가시나무였다. 살아온 세월이 있는지라 실로 많은 사람들을 스쳐 갔지만, 그는 그 누구에게도 자신에게 기대는 것을 허락하지 않았다.

그러나 단 한 사람, 장천은 예외였다.

“너는 어떠했느냐? 한순간이라도 이 스승이 든든한 버팀목으로 느껴졌더냐?”

그를 떠올린 적천강의 눈빛이 흐릿해졌다. 그러나 이제는 전만큼 가슴이 아프지도, 눈이 뜨거워지지도 않았다.

죽은 이는 이미 한 줌 흙으로 돌아갔다.

적천강은 제자가 피를 뿌리며 쓰러졌을 그 어딘가에서 한 병의 술을 마시고 한 동이의 술을 뿌렸다.

지난 십 년간 흘리지 못한 눈물을 펑펑 흘리며 마음의 한 또한 함께 흘려보냈다.

“미안하구나. 널 생각하는 것은 오늘이 마지막이다.”

다음이 있다면 그것은 내세(來世)의 일.

문득문득 죽은 제자를 떠올릴 때가 있을지도 모른다. 그러나 그것은 지난날에 대한 후회가 아닌 추억일 것이다.

“이걸로 됐다. 이러면 되는 게야.”

한참 동안 마당을 서성이던 적천강이 멈칫했다. 눈앞에 어른거리던 장천의 얼굴이 사라지고 생각지도 못한 놈이 떠올랐기 때문이었다.

‘이놈이 왜?’

시원시원하게 생긴 이목구비. 자신만만하면서도 어딘지 모르게 밉살맞은 웃음.

그리고 눈치를 살살 살피면서도 그의 날 선 말들을 받아 주는 모습까지.

‘아까 망할 늙은이라고 한 것 때문에 나도 모르게 화가 났나?’

적천강이 미간을 찌푸리던 그때였다.

치지직.

뭔가가 타들어 가는 소리와 함께 가느다란 연기가 피어올랐다.

소리의 진원지를 알아챈 그가 눈을 부릅떴다.

“비, 비급!”

이미 겉장이 반쯤 타 버린 화염신장의 비급을 본 적천강이 노호성을 내질렀다.

“진태경! 이 쳐 죽일 놈아-!”

# Chapter 195

The banquet held on New Year’s Day had been such a resounding success that calling it merely a success felt insufficient.

By embracing the Mount Heng Sword Sect, Jin Wikyung had made a bold move that won the loyalty of dozens of mid- and small-sized sects. The Zhongnan Sect’s intervention and the appearance of Fire King Jeok Cheongang, whom everyone had believed dead, had left them all stunned.

And…

*I was one of the people left stunned, too.*

I ate, drank, and moved from place to place. Wherever I went, people’s eyes followed my every movement.

Half a day ago, those gazes had meant interest in the Sleeping Dragon of Shanxi.

But not anymore.

*The Fire King’s Disciple. The Fire Gate Clan’s heir.*

Those words were drifting through the crowd everywhere I went. People were endlessly discussing what it meant that Jeok Cheongang, the current Sect Leader of the Fire Gate Clan, had entrusted me with the sect’s sacred treasure—and why he had protected the Jin Family of Taiyuan even while making an enemy of the Zhongnan Sect.

*It feels like this has already become half-confirmed as fact.*

To be honest, I didn’t understand Jeok Cheongang’s intentions either.

That was why I was here.

And now, while everyone was distracted, I had slipped away. This was my chance.

“Phew.”

I took a deep breath.

I was standing in front of the pavilion where Jeok Cheongang had been given lodging. No one—not even a mouse—was anywhere near the large pavilion. Someone must have issued orders to keep the area clear.

“Great Hero Jeok. Are you there?”

A reply came from beyond the door.

“I’m sleeping.”

“I came because there’s something I wanted to ask you.”

“I said I’m sleeping.”

“…How are you answering me if you’re asleep?”

“I’m sleepwalking.”

Was that an answer or a whinny?

It made no sense, but if the Fire King said that was how it was, then that was how it was. I pulled myself together and spoke again.

“Um, there’s something I’ve been wondering about no matter how much I think it over.”

“Am I someone who solves your problems for you?”

“No, but…”

“If you know that, go wash your feet and get some sleep.”

Talk about an impenetrable wall.

But I couldn’t back down now.

I was cautiously creeping toward the firmly closed door when—

“Take one more step, and you won’t live to see tomorrow’s sunrise.”

“…How did you know?”

“To this old man, your presence is no different from the sound of thunder.”

“Please don’t be like that. Couldn’t you let me in now? It’s still winter, so it’s rather chilly outside.”

“Should this old man warm you up with the Flame Divine Palm?”

“…”

Just hearing that made my insides feel hot.

When I fell silent, silence descended once more. After a while, Jeok Cheongang broke it with a single sentence.

“I went to Jeongyang.”

“Ah.”

Even an insignificant bead could hold special meaning for someone. Jeongyang was like that.

Of the dozens of counties and towns in Shanxi Province, Jeongyang was nothing special. But Jeok Cheongang had had a reason to visit a mountain path somewhere there.

*Jopil.*

On that day, when the sky had poured down snow, a man who had lived as Jangcheon died under the name Jopil.

“I stayed for a long time at the place you told me about. Some passersby saw an old man wandering around the foot of the mountain and asked why I was there.”

His subdued voice continued.

“I told them that a blood relative had died right there. That I had come because I wanted to recover whatever remained of his body.”

“…”

“That was when I realized something. Even if I had met that boy before you did, I could never have killed him. I would have let him go again—and regretted it.”

It was difficult to imagine what expression Jeok Cheongang wore on the other side of the door.

After hesitating, I asked:

“Did you find the body?”

“Nothing was left.”

Several months had already passed.

He had spent his entire life walking a path of blood. The subordinates who might have recovered his body had died with him, too. He had either been buried by the capricious weather or become food for hungry beasts.

“It’s an old man’s greed. Ugly and pointless.”

Glug.

The sound of liquor filling a cup rang unusually loudly.

“I thought you said you were drunk earlier.”

“You crafty brat. Why ask when you already know?”

The candlelight filling the pavilion cast his silhouette across the walls.

Jeok Cheongang let out a quiet laugh, then tipped back his cup.

“Ahh. Good.”

His voice sounded refreshed, as though a single drink had washed away his troubles.

It occurred to me that Jeok Cheongang had gone to the place where Jopil died to shake off the regret and lingering attachment that still held him there.

I spoke in a deliberately brighter voice.

“I was taught that good things should be shared.”

“I was taught from a young age that anyone who coveted other people’s things should be burned with the Flame Divine Palm.”

“What terrifying person taught you that?”

“My Master.”

That’s the Volcano Gate Clan for you. Ruthless.

They burned everyone with the Flame Divine Palm.

I didn’t know the history of the Fire Gate Clan or the names of its past Sect Leaders, but looking at Jeok Cheongang, I could make a rough guess.

*An old sect of thugs.*

They say beans grow where beans are planted, and red beans where red beans are planted.

The disciple takes after the master. Jopil was the exception, of course.

*Anyway, that isn’t why I came here.*

I was watching the silhouette inside the pavilion while trying to read the situation when Jeok Cheongang suddenly spoke.

“From now on, the Fire Heaven Sword is yours.”

“Fire… what?”

“The Fire Heaven Sword. The sword I entrusted to you.”

I had learned the true name of the Unnamed Sword, but that wasn’t the issue right now. I was so shocked that I even stammered.

“B-but this is the Fire Gate Clan’s sacred treasure.”

“Ah. The sacred treasure.”

Jeok Cheongang tilted back yet another cup of liquor and continued.

“That was a lie.”

“What?”

“It isn’t a sacred treasure. About a hundred years ago, one of our sect’s Sect Leaders used it. Later generations inherited it from him. It’s old, but it was already famous as a divine weapon back then, so it should still be useful.”

“…”

What the hell was he talking about?

I stood there with my mouth hanging open at this shocking truth I had never expected.

“That was all a lie? You’re messing with me, right?”

“Messing with you? Why would I bother with a little pup like you?”

“You said it in front of everyone! ‘I entrusted this boy with the Fire Gate Clan’s sacred treasure!’”

“I did. Because we were in front of everyone.”

Jeok Cheongang continued in a bored voice.

“I had to go that far for people to start talking. ‘That boy must have a deep connection to the Fire King. Since he was entrusted with the sacred treasure, perhaps he is the Fire King’s Disciple. If we provoke the Jin Family of Taiyuan, that terrifying Fire King will step in.’ Rumors like that will spread far and wide.”

“…”

“Do you really think this old man would entrust our sect’s sacred treasure to a young brat like you? Our arts are passed down to only one successor per generation, so there’s no one else who would know. If I say it’s a sacred treasure, then it’s a sacred treasure.”

“…”

“So keep the sword. That way, those Zhongnan bastards won’t dare make a move.”

*Is this a dream?*

As I stood there in shock, a System notification rang in my ears, delivering the final blow.

Ding.

> **System**
>
> Information regarding the Unnamed Sword has been updated.
>
> **Item Window**
>
> **Fire Heaven Sword**
>
> **Type:** Sword  
> **Grade:** Peak  
> **Restriction:** One who has inherited the Fire Gate Clan’s legacy  
> **Description:** The beloved sword once used by the Fire Gate Clan’s tenth Sect Leader. Forged from Ten-Thousand-Year Cold Iron, it is exceptionally sharp and durable. After passing through the hands of countless owners over the course of many years, it changed of its own accord. Only one who has inherited the Fire Gate Clan’s legacy can draw out its true power.
>
> **Effect:** Unknown

The updated information was exactly as Jeok Cheongang had said.

It was the beloved sword of the tenth Sect Leader. No mention of the Fire Gate Clan’s sacred treasure anywhere, no matter how hard I looked.

Even the so-called “true power” hidden within the sword could only be drawn out by someone who had inherited the Fire Gate Clan’s legacy.

In other words, take away the fact that it was made of Ten-Thousand-Year Cold Iron, and the sword was a corpse.

*I really thought it was a sacred treasure. I spent so much time worrying about what I’d do if he said he was going to make me a Disciple…*

As I stared blankly at the holographic window, Jeok Cheongang added as though he were doing me a great favor:

“Think of it as a long-term loan. If this old man forgets about it and dies, you may keep it. Ah, and hand over the Flame Divine Palm manual right now.”

“Damn old man…”

“Gasp.”

I had only meant to think that, but it slipped out of my mouth.

The moment I clapped my mouth shut in alarm, the firmly closed pavilion door exploded outward.

Crack!

A pair of eyes burning with flames glared at me.

“You little pup. What did you just say?”

“I-I-I misspoke.”

“Misspoke? Then this old man will make a little mistake with his hand, too.”

Whoosh!

A palm glowing red-hot. An overwhelming wave of heat.

I turned around without even looking back. In the same instant, I pulled the Flame Divine Palm manual from my Inventory and threw it.

“Gasp! The manual—the Flame Divine Palm manual!”

If he reached out now, the manual would turn to ash.

Jeok Cheongang, startled, hastily pulled back his fist. I took advantage of the opening and ran with all my might.

“I’m sorry! I’m really sorry! Please spare me!”

“You damned bastard! Stop right there!”

His roar rang out thunderously behind me.

* * *

Jeok Cheongang watched Jin Taekyung’s back as he fled as though his tail were on fire and let out a quiet laugh.

The anger that had filled his face only moments ago had vanished without a trace.

“You little fool. No matter how far you run, you’re still in the palm of this old man’s hand.”

If he wanted to catch him, he could do so at any time.

But Jeok Cheongang merely clasped his hands behind his back and turned around.

Jin Taekyung was the man who had killed Jangcheon, the Disciple Jeok Cheongang had cherished like a son.

Yet Jeok Cheongang did not hate him.

If anything, Taekyung was one of the people to whom Jeok Cheongang truly owed an apology.

Everything had begun with a wrong choice he had made ten years ago.

“He called me a damn old man.”

Despite being cursed out by a young pup, Jeok Cheongang did not feel bad.

No—in fact, he felt refreshed.

“That’s right. I am a damn old man. A senile old man, too. Heh heh. Heh heh heh.”

After his Master died, no one had dared criticize or curse Jeok Cheongang to his face.

He was the Fire King. A great martial artist who had written his own legend.

And yet, hearing that one remark from Jin Taekyung made him feel as though something that had been blocked for a long time had suddenly burst open.

“It feels good. So good.”

As people grow older, they become lonelier day by day. Not because they have no one with whom to share their warmth, but because they have no one to lean on.

A person might serve as someone else’s support, but Jeok Cheongang had grown too old to lean on anyone himself.

“To be someone’s support…”

Jeok Cheongang was a rough, sharp thorn tree. He had lived a long life and crossed paths with countless people, but he had never allowed any of them to lean on him.

There had been only one exception.

Jangcheon.

“What about you? Did you ever feel, even for a moment, that this Master was a dependable support?”

As Jeok Cheongang thought of him, his eyes grew clouded. But his chest did not hurt as much as it once had, nor did his eyes grow hot.

The dead had already returned to a handful of earth.

Jeok Cheongang had drunk a bottle of liquor at the place where his Disciple had fallen after spilling his blood, then poured out an entire crockful.

He had wept freely, shedding the tears he had been unable to shed for the past ten years and letting the grief in his heart flow out with them.

“I’m sorry. Today will be the last time I think of you.”

If there was a next time, that belonged to the next life.

He might still think of his dead Disciple from time to time. But those thoughts would no longer be regrets about the past.

They would be memories.

“This is enough. This is how it should be.”

After wandering around the courtyard for a long while, Jeok Cheongang suddenly stopped.

The image of Jangcheon that had been flickering before his eyes vanished, replaced by someone he had never expected to think of.

*Why him?*

Clear-cut features. A confident smile that was somehow irritating.

And the way he cautiously gauged Jeok Cheongang’s mood while still taking all of his sharp remarks in stride.

*Did I get angry without realizing it because he called me a damn old man?*

Jeok Cheongang was frowning when—

Sizzle.

The sound of something burning filled the air, followed by a thin trail of smoke.

Realizing where the sound had come from, he opened his eyes wide.

“The manual!”

The cover of the Flame Divine Palm manual was already half-burned.

Jeok Cheongang let out a furious roar.

“Jin Taekyung! You damned bastard!”
