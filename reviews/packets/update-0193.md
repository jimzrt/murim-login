＃193화



열화문의 신물.

화왕의 입에서 그 낯선 단어가 튀어나온 순간, 노호검객의 눈이 찢어질 듯 팽창했다.

“그, 그게 무슨 말씀이십니까.”

“칠순도 안 된 놈이 벌써부터 귓구멍이 막혔나. 한 번 더 말해 줄 테니 똑똑히 들어라.”

적천강이 짜증 난 듯한 얼굴로 나를 향해 턱짓했다.

“본문의 신물을 저놈한테 맡겼다. 됐느냐?”

“…….”

“…….”

되긴 뭐가 돼.

나는 황당한 얼굴로 주위를 둘러봤다. 진위경과 백무성을 포함한 모두가 경악한 얼굴로 나와 적천강을 번갈아 보는 중이었다.

이 혼돈의 도가니 속, 유일하게 영향을 받지 않은 한 사람이 입을 열었다.

“은인, 열화문의 신물이 뭐예요? 나도 보여 줘요.”

나는 청풍의 질문에 대답할 수 없었다.

‘나도 몰라, 이 새끼야.’

열화문의 신물이라니. 뭐야 그게.

맹세컨대 그런 물건은 듣도 보도 못했다.

내가 적천강에게 받은 물건이라고는 화염신장의 비급과 검 한 자루뿐인……데.

아, 잠깐만.

“혹시?”

설마 하는 내 시선에 적천강이 혀를 찼다.

“등에 메어 놓고도 모르다니. 멍청한 놈.”

망치로 뒤통수를 얻어맞은 기분이다.

나는 황급히 단단히 고정시킨 매듭을 풀었다. 칭칭 감싸 둔 천을 벗겨 내자 낡고 투박한 검갑이 모습을 드러낸다.

‘이름 없는 검.’

조필이 스승에게서 훔치고, 나에게 빼앗긴 바로 그 물건.

검파를 움켜쥐고 당겼다.

스르릉, 솜털이 곤두서는 소리와 함께 새하얀 검신이 드러난다.

내리깔린 어둠 속, 마치 전설 속 성검(聖劍)처럼 빛나는 모습에 사람들이 탄성을 내질렀다.

‘그럼 이게 정말…… 열화문의 신물?’

지금까지 단 한 번도 의심해 보지 않았다.

왜 조필이 적천강에게서 이것을 훔쳤는지. 왜 화염신장이나 열화신단과 달리 [이름 없는 검]이라는 괴상한 설명이 붙었는지.

내가 넋 나간 얼굴로 검신을 바라보던 그때였다.

“이, 이건 말도 안 됩니다!”

노호검객이다. 극도의 당황과 흥분에 휩싸인 그와는 달리 적천강의 안색은 평온, 그 자체였다.

“무엇이 말이냐?”

“그, 그것이.”

“노부가 저 녀석에게 열화문의 신물을 맡겼다. 네놈이 제아무리 대가리에 똥만 가득 찬 놈이라지만 그것이 무슨 뜻인지 모르지 않을 터.”

순간 정신이 번쩍 들었다.

검에 정신이 팔려서 잠시 잊고 있었다. 한 문파, 그것도 수백 년간 일인전승으로 계승된 열화문의 신물이 가진 의미를.

더불어 불과 반나절 전에 청풍이 했던 말이 뇌리를 스쳤다.



‘은인을 제자로 삼으려는 것 아니에요?’



당시에는 허무맹랑한 헛소리라 생각하고 웃어넘겼다.

하지만 이제는…….

‘시바, 나도 모르겠다.’

마른침만 꼴깍거리는 내게 노호검객의 삿대질이 날아들었다.

하지만 미처 입을 떼기도 전에 적천강의 무시무시한 눈빛이 그를 꽁꽁 옭아맸다.

“노부가, 본문의 신물을, 맡겼다고 했다.”

그것이 전부였다. 하지만 상대는 다름 아닌 화왕이다.

노호검객에게는 반박할 수 있는 용기가 남아 있지 않았다. 입술을 잘근잘근 씹던 그가 돌연 나를 노려보았다.

“놈. 운이 좋구나.”

이 노인네는 왜 또 나한테 지랄이야.

적천강도 별말이 없다. 이 정도는 알아서 해결하라는 건가? 나는 노호검객을 향해 어깨를 으쓱해 보였다.

“사람 잘못 보셨네요. 저 운 되게 없는데.”

내가 시발, 운이 좋았으면 너 같은 새끼를 만났겠냐.

일촉즉발로 치닫던 상황에 적천강이 왔으니 이걸 대흉(大凶)이라고 해야 할지, 대길(大吉)이라고 해야 할지는 모르겠지만.

“뭐 아무튼 만나서 반가웠습니다. 조심히 들어가시고요.”

“교활한 놈. 어디 아까 전처럼 해 보지 그러느냐?”

“아까 전처럼? 아, 좆 같다고 한 거요?”

노호검객이 뭐라 할 틈도 없이 고개를 꾸벅 숙였다.

“그 부분에 있어서는 죄송합니다. 제가 불의를 보면 못 참는 성격이라서. 까마득한 후배의 말실수라고 생각하고 봐주십쇼. 대. 협.”

“……!”

노호검객의 몸이 부르르 떨렸다. 꽉 움켜쥔 주먹에서는 피가 뚝뚝 떨어졌다.

그의 모습에서 불과 몇 분 전의 내가 보였다. 우리 두 사람의 차이가 있다면 나는 노호검객에게 굴하지 않았지만 그는 화왕에게 굴복했다는 것이다.

힘을 앞세운 자는 더 큰 힘 앞에 무릎을 꿇는다. 세상의 본질을 재확인한 것 같아 마냥 통쾌하지만은 않았다.

아니, 오히려 씁쓸하기까지 했다.

‘기분 더럽네.’

적천강이 아니었다면 지금 저자가 느끼는 치욕과 분노는 나와 태원진가의 몫이 되었을 테니까.

이 자리의 몇 사람만 나선다면 노호검객 개인을 쓰러트리는 건 어렵지 않다. 그러나 그의 뒤에는 종남파가 있다.

인정하기는 싫지만…… 그들과 우리의 격차는 크다. 그것은 지금으로서는 결코 좁힐 수 없는 간격이다.

‘지금은, 말이지.’

만년 F급 헌터였던 내가 여기까지 왔다. 세상일은 어떻게 될지 모른다.

혹시 모르지, 언젠가 태원진가가 구파일방, 오대세가와 어깨를 나란히 하게 될지도.

‘아, 이건 너무 나갔나?’

시골 면장이 대통령 선거에 도전하는 거나 마찬가지다.

그런 생각을 하며 피식 웃자 노호검객이 이를 갈았다.

“감히 나를 비웃어?”

“원래 웃는 인상이라 그런 건데요.”

“그 입 닥치지 못할까!”

분노에 가득 찬 고함이 터져 나온 그 순간, 적천강의 오른발이 번개 같은 속도로 노호검객의 정강이를 걷어찼다.

무려 초절정 고수의 조인트 킥이다.

퍽!

“커흑!”

“너나 닥쳐라. 어린노무 새끼가 어디 어른 앞에서 목소리를 높여?”

“지금 이게 무슨 짓입니까!”

“이 새끼 보게. 가급적 좋게 끝내려고 했더니 매를 벌어?”

뻑!

“억!”

와, 이건 제대로 들어갔다.

방금 전보다 더 둔탁한 타격음과 함께 노호검객이 정강이를 붙잡고 쓰러졌다.

‘크, 대종남파의 장로도 별수 없구나.’

높은 사회적 위치에 환갑이 넘은 나이지만 상대가 워낙 넘사벽이었다.

나이, 무공, 신분. 그 어느 것으로도 따라잡을 수 없는 존재가 바로 화왕 적천강 아닌가.

“지랄도 그 정도면 병이니라. 할 만큼 했으면 이만 썩 꺼져라.”

“……그러지요.”

원독에 찬 눈빛으로 나를 노려본 노호검객이 흙투성이가 된 몸을 일으키던 그때, 서늘한 목소리가 이어졌다.

“또한 내 오늘 일은 불문에 부칠 터이니 다시는 이에 관해 논하지 말거라. 무슨 말인지 알아들었느냐?”

이거 정말 팬클럽이라도 만들어야겠다.

일단 내킨 걸음이라 막 지르긴 했지만 내심 걱정이 있었던 것도 사실이다. 후일 노호검객이 종남파를 앞세워 보복한다면 태원진가로서는 막을 방법이 없기 때문이다.

하지만 적천강의 중재가 있다면 말이 달라진다.

‘중재인지 협박인지는 모르겠지만.’

오늘 일에 대한 앙금은 남겠지만 최소한 공식적인 압박을 가해 오지는 않을 것이다.

설령 그런 일이 있더라도 화왕이라는 든든한 방파제가 있으니 부담감이 훨씬 적다.

“왜 대답이 없느냐?”

개수작을 간파당한 노호검객의 얼굴은 참혹하게 일그러져 있었다. 물론 적천강은 아랑곳하지 않았다.

“네 입으로 말해라. 지금 당장.”

“……알겠습니다. 제 이름을 걸고 약속하지요.”

“네깟놈 주제에 무슨 이름을 걸어? 종남파의 이름으로 약속해라.”

“으드득, 알겠습니다.”

그제야 적천강의 입가에 흡족한 미소가 떠올랐다. 그가 허허 웃으며 노호검객의 어깨를 두드렸다.

“어린노무 새끼가 어디서 이빨 가는 법을 배웠누. 확 그냥 이빨을 죄다 잡아 뽑아 버릴까 보다.”

“…….”

“허허허, 노부도 나이가 있으니 사람들 보는 앞에서 그럴 수도 없고. 껄껄껄!”

호호백발 노인의 웃음이 이렇게 무서울 수 있다는 걸 처음 알았다.

노호검객뿐만 아니라 듣고 있던 사람들 모두가 동시에 몸을 움찔 떨 정도다.

악귀처럼 웃던 적천강이 내게 고개를 돌렸다.

“네 녀석도 잘한 것 없다. 사정이 어찌 되었건 까마득한 어른에게 그런 폭언을 퍼붓다니. 제정신이냐?”

나는 냉큼 고개를 숙였다. 어찌 되었건 사실은 사실이고, 종남파의 장로인 노호검객과 이쯤에서 마무리를 지어야겠다는 생각이 들었기 때문이다.

“죄송합니다.”

“아무리 나이를 똥구멍으로 처먹었어도 환갑이면 너만 한 손주가 있어도 이상하지 않을 나이다.”

“……아, 네.”

“아무리 개 같은 놈이어도 어른이고 무림의 대선배다. 더럽고 치사해도 앞으로는 예의를 깍듯이 갖추어라.”

“송 대협. 진심으로 사죄드리겠습니다.”

폴더 인사를 하고 허리를 펴자 붉게 달아오른 노호검객의 얼굴이 보인다. 사과를 받아도 받은 기분이 아닐 거다.

반면 나는 싫은 놈에게 사과를 하고도 운기조식을 한 것처럼 기분이 상쾌했다.

‘이게 바로 연륜인가.’

백 년의 세월 동안 단련된 말빨 봐라.

무공만 초절정이 아니다. 이 정도면 별호를 화왕이 아니라 혀왕으로 바꿔도 될 정도다.

자신의 입회하에 모든 합의 절차를 끝마친 혀왕은 준엄한 목소리로 선언했다.

“자, 이제 초대받지 않은 놈들은 모두 꺼져라. 배고프면 밥이나 한 그릇 하고 가든가.”

이제는 숫제 거지 취급이다. 모멸감에 몸을 떨던 노호검객이 한참 만에 입을 뗐다.

“……그럼 이만 물러가겠습니다.”

“멀리 안 나간다.”

“가자!”

노호검객은 그 말을 기다렸다는 듯 세차게 돌아섰다. 오만상을 쓰고 있던 공일혁과 종남삼수의 두 사람이 그 뒤를 따랐다.

네 사람의 등 뒤를 따가운 시선들이 쫓았다. 대문을 나서려던 그가 문득 고개를 돌려 나를 응시했다.

살기가 담긴 한 줄기 전음과 함께.

- 저 늙은이와 무슨 인연이 있는지는 모르겠으나…… 내 숨이 붙어 있는 한 반드시 네놈과 태원진가를 벌할 것이다.

그건 찰나라고 부를 수 있을 만큼 짧은 순간 벌어진 일이었다.

이내 어둠 속으로 녹아드는 노호검객의 뒷모습을 알 수 없는 표정으로 바라보던 화왕이 한 마디를 툭 던졌다.

“잠시 나갔다 오마.”

“예? 어디 가시게요?”

“이 나이에 소피보러 가는 것도 일일이 보고하리?”

퉁명스럽게 내뱉은 그는 팔자걸음으로 사라졌다.



* * *



태원진가에서 멀어진 노호검객이 돌연 검을 뽑아 휘둘렀다.

쉬이이잉! 콰광!

수십 줄기의 검기가 나무를 가르고 바위를 부쉈다. 한참 동안 계속되던 그의 분노는 마침내 공일혁을 포함한 종남삼수를 향했다.

“이런 멍청한 놈들…….”

“자, 장로님.”

“네깟놈들 때문에 노부가 무슨 모욕을 당했는지 아느냐!”

“죄, 죄송합니다. 부디 불민한 제자들을 용서해 주십시오.”

종남삼수는 바짝 얼어붙었다.

그중에서도 특히 겁에 질린 사람은 공일혁이었다. 그가 노호검객을 부추겨 태원진가로 오지 않았다면 이런 일은 없었을 테니까.

“자, 장로님. 진정하시고 제 얘기를 들어 주십시오.”

“장문 사제를 인척으로 뒀다고 몇 번 눈감아 줬더니 뵈는 게 없는 모양이구나.”

콱!

노호검객의 비쩍 마른 손이 공일혁의 목을 움켜쥐었다.

“커흑, 저, 저는 문주님의…….”

“너 하나쯤 벌한다고 해서 장문 사제가 눈 하나 깜짝할 것 같으냐? 버러지 같은 놈.”

공일혁의 얼굴이 새하얗게 질린 그 때였다.

툭. 투둑. 털썩.

그의 몸이 축 늘어지고 고개가 꺾였다. 겁에 질려 있던 종남삼수의 다른 두 사람도 그 자리에서 힘없이 무너져 내렸다.

“이, 이놈들이 갑자기 왜.”

잠시 당황하던 노호검객이 문득 고개를 돌렸다. 어둠 속을 빤히 노려보던 그가 입을 열었다.

“아직 볼일이 남으셨습니까?”

“그러니 찾아온 것 아니겠느냐?”

태연한 목소리와 함께 작은 체구의 노인, 화왕 적천강이 모습을 드러냈다.

그는 쓰러진 종남삼수를 보며 혀를 찼다.

“쯧쯔. 본의 아니게 저놈들을 구해 준 셈이 됐군. 좀 나중에 올 걸 그랬나?”

“무슨 일로 다시 오셨습니까.”

“오랜만인데 그냥 보내기 아쉬워서 와 봤다.”

화왕이 싱긋 웃으며 덧붙였다.

“잊은 것도 있고.”

“잊은 거라니, 그게 무슨…….”

그 순간, 적천강의 신형이 허깨비처럼 사라졌다. 동시에 대경한 노호검객의 허리춤에서 검기가 솟구쳤다.

쉬쉬쉬쉬쉭!

반경 삼 장. 닿는 순간 뼈와 살을 가르는 촘촘한 검기의 그물이 펼쳐졌다.

그러나 대어는 이미 물살을 거슬러 오른 후였다.

“아까 말했지. 녀석의 털끝 하나 건드리지 말라고.”

콰직!

노호검객의 손아귀에서 검파가 떨어졌다. 손목이 부러진 그가 비명을 내지르며 무릎을 차올렸다.

“크아악! 이 개 같은 늙은이가!”

“언제쯤 사람이 될꼬.”

동시에 새하얀 백염(白炎)에 휩싸인 손바닥이 노호검객의 가슴을 짚었다.

펑!

“커……헉!”

막을 수 없는 일장.

호신강기가 깨져 나가고 뼈와 살이 익는다. 토혈과 함께 무릎을 꿇은 노호검객의 눈꺼풀이 파르르 떨렸다.

“쿨럭. 화, 화염신장…….”

“고개를 들어 나를 보아라.”

노인의 목소리는 화왕이라는 별호가 무색할 만큼 싸늘했다.

가까스로 고개를 든 노호검객은 새파란 귀화가 일렁이는 한 쌍의 눈과 마주했다.

“화, 화왕.”

“그래, 노부가 화왕이니라.”

잠시 잊고 있었다. 화왕 적천강이 어느 정도의 괴물인지.

일평생 무림에서 활동한 기간은 단 일 년. 그러나 그는 단 한 번의 전투로 전설이 되었고 무림사에 자신의 족적을 새겼다.

결코 대항할 수 없는 상대. 노호검객의 얼굴 위로 짙은 절망이 내려앉았다.

“나를, 나를 죽일 셈이오?”

“널 죽여서 모든 걸 끝낼 수 있다면 진즉 죽이고도 남았겠지.”

“그럼…….”

“하나만 기억해라.”

화왕은 천천히 입술을 뗐다.

“진태경. 그 아이를 죽여도 좋다. 태원진가를 멸문시켜도 지켜보겠다. 단, 그런 일이 벌어진다면 나는 종남파로 찾아갈 것이다.”

“……!”

“종남파의 현판을 박살 내고 종남산을 불태우겠다. 본산을 버리고 도망친다면 끝까지 쫓아가 모조리 죽이겠다. 내 숨이 끊기는 그 날까지.”

무시무시한 살기에 노호검객의 전신이 덜덜 떨렸다.

지금 적천강이 하는 말은 모두 진심이다. 단신으로 종남파를 대적하겠다고 선언하고 있는 것이다.

만약 그런 일이 벌어진다면 얼마나 많은 희생을 치러야 할지 상상도 되지 않았다.

“내, 내가 어찌해야 하오?”

“선택은 너의 몫. 그에 대한 징죄(懲罪)는 노부의 몫이니라.”

적천강은 그 한 마디를 남기고 홀연히 사라졌다.

그리고 한참 뒤에야 깨어난 종남삼수는 넋 나간 얼굴로 주저앉아 있는 노호검객의 모습을 발견하고 화들짝 놀랐다.

“자, 장로님!”

“이게 어찌된 일입니까!”

“도대체 누가!”

노호검객이 입을 연 것은 아주 오랜 시간이 흐른 후였다.

“돌아간다. 종남으로.”

공포와 두려움이 묻어 나오는 그의 목소리에, 종남삼수는 아무 말도 할 수 없었다.

# Chapter 193

## The Fire Gate Clan’s Sacred Treasure

The moment that unfamiliar phrase sprang from the Fire King’s mouth, the Roaring Fury Swordsman’s eyes bulged as though they were about to tear apart.

“W-what do you mean?”

“You haven’t even turned seventy, and your ears are already clogged? I’ll say it one more time, so listen carefully.”

Jeok Cheongang jerked his chin toward me with an irritated expression.

“This old man entrusted our sect’s sacred treasure to that brat. Got it?”

“…”

“…”

*What do you mean, got it?*

I looked around with a bewildered expression. Everyone, including Jin Wikyung and Baek Museong, was staring back and forth between Jeok Cheongang and me in shock.

Amid this chaotic mess, one person alone remained unaffected.

“Benefactor, what’s the Fire Gate Clan’s sacred treasure? Show me, too.”

I couldn’t answer Cheongpung’s question.

*I don’t know either, you little shit.*

The Fire Gate Clan’s sacred treasure? What was he talking about?

I swore I had never heard or seen such an item.

The only things I had received from Jeok Cheongang were the martial arts manual for the Flame Divine Palm and a sword…

*Wait.*

“Could it be?”

At my doubtful gaze, Jeok Cheongang clicked his tongue.

“You’ve been carrying it on your back and still didn’t know? What a moron.”

It felt as though I had just been hit in the back of the head with a hammer.

I hurriedly untied the knot holding it firmly in place. When I unwound the layers of cloth, an old, crude scabbard appeared.

*The Unnamed Sword.*

The very item Jopil had stolen from his Master—and which I had taken from him.

I gripped the hilt and drew.

Shing!

With a sound that made every hair on my body stand on end, the pure-white blade emerged.

Beneath the darkness, it shone like a holy sword from legend, drawing gasps from the people around us.

*So this really is… the Fire Gate Clan’s sacred treasure?*

I had never once suspected it.

Why Jopil had stolen it from Jeok Cheongang. Why it had been given the strange description *Unnamed Sword*, unlike the Flame Divine Palm or the Blazing Flame Divine Pill.

I was staring blankly at the blade when—

“T-this is impossible!”

It was the Roaring Fury Swordsman. Unlike him, overwhelmed by extreme confusion and excitement, Jeok Cheongang’s expression was perfectly calm.

“What is?”

“T-that…”

“This old man entrusted the Fire Gate Clan’s sacred treasure to that brat. You may have nothing but shit in your head, but surely you understand what that means.”

I suddenly came to my senses.

I had been so distracted by the sword that I had briefly forgotten what it meant for a sect’s sacred treasure to have been entrusted to someone—especially the sacred treasure of the Fire Gate Clan, which had been passed down through a single lineage for hundreds of years.

At the same time, Cheongpung’s words from barely half a day ago flashed through my mind.

*“Are you going to take Benefactor as your Disciple?”*

At the time, I had thought it was ridiculous nonsense and laughed it off.

But now…

*Fuck. I don’t know either.*

As I swallowed dryly, the Roaring Fury Swordsman pointed a finger at me.

But before he could even speak, Jeok Cheongang’s terrifying gaze bound him in place.

“This old man said he entrusted our sect’s sacred treasure to him.”

That was all.

But his opponent was none other than the Fire King.

The Roaring Fury Swordsman no longer had the courage to argue. He chewed on his lips, then suddenly glared at me.

“You bastard. You’re lucky.”

*Why is this old man starting shit with me again?*

Jeok Cheongang said nothing. Was he telling me to handle something this minor on my own?

I shrugged at the Roaring Fury Swordsman.

“You’ve got the wrong man. I’m actually really unlucky.”

*If I were lucky, do you think I would’ve met a piece of shit like you?*

I didn’t know whether Jeok Cheongang’s arrival in a situation that had been on the verge of exploding counted as great misfortune or great fortune.

“Anyway, it was nice meeting you. Have a safe trip home.”

“You cunning bastard. Why don’t you try what you did earlier?”

“What, earlier? Oh, you mean when I said you were fucking shitty?”

Before the Roaring Fury Swordsman could say anything, I bowed my head.

“I apologize for that. I have a hard time tolerating injustice. Please forgive a slip of the tongue from a junior far beneath you. Great. Hero.”

“……!”

The Roaring Fury Swordsman’s body trembled. Blood dripped from his tightly clenched fists.

Looking at him, I saw myself from a few minutes earlier. The difference between us was that I had not bowed to the Roaring Fury Swordsman, while he had submitted to the Fire King.

Those who rely on power kneel before greater power. Realizing that fundamental truth of the world again was satisfying, but not entirely.

No, it was even bitter.

*This leaves a bad taste in my mouth.*

If Jeok Cheongang had not been here, the humiliation and fury that man felt would have belonged to me and the Jin Family of Taiyuan.

If only a few people here stepped forward, defeating the Roaring Fury Swordsman himself would not be difficult. But behind him stood the Zhongnan Sect.

I hated admitting it, but the gap between them and us was vast. For now, it was a distance that could never be closed.

*For now.*

I had been a perpetual F-rank Hunter, yet I had still made it this far. No one knew what the future held.

Maybe one day the Jin Family of Taiyuan would stand shoulder to shoulder with the Nine Sects and One Gang and the Five Great Families.

*Am I getting ahead of myself?*

It was like a rural township chief running for president.

I snorted quietly at the thought, and the Roaring Fury Swordsman ground his teeth.

“How dare you laugh at me?”

“I was born with a smiley expression.”

“Shut that mouth of yours!”

At the moment his furious shout erupted, Jeok Cheongang’s right foot shot out like lightning and kicked the Roaring Fury Swordsman in the shin.

A Supreme Peak master’s joint kick.

Thud!

“Guh!”

“You shut up. Where does a young bastard like you raise his voice in front of an elder?”

“What do you think you’re doing?”

“Look at this bastard. I tried to end things nicely, and now you’re begging for a beating?”

Wham!

“Urgh!”

*Wow. That one landed.*

With a heavier impact than before, the Roaring Fury Swordsman clutched his shin and collapsed.

*Even an Elder of the Great Zhongnan Sect is helpless against him.*

He was over sixty and held a high position in society, but his opponent was simply on another level.

Age, martial arts, status. There was no way to catch up to the Fire King, Jeok Cheongang, in any of them.

“Carrying on like that is a disease. You’ve done enough, so get the hell out of here.”

“…Very well.”

The Roaring Fury Swordsman glared at me with a resentful gaze as he rose, his body covered in dirt. Then a cold voice followed.

“Also, I will let today’s events pass, so never speak of this matter again. Do you understand?”

*I really should start a fan club.*

I had acted on impulse, but I had been worried on some level. If the Roaring Fury Swordsman later used the Zhongnan Sect to retaliate, the Jin Family of Taiyuan would have no way to stop him.

But with Jeok Cheongang mediating, things were different.

*Whether this is mediation or a threat, I’m not sure.*

The resentment over today’s events would remain, but at least he would not be able to bring official pressure against us.

Even if he did, having the Fire King as a sturdy shield made the burden far lighter.

“Why aren’t you answering?”

The Roaring Fury Swordsman’s face twisted hideously, his cheap ploy having been seen through. Jeok Cheongang, of course, did not care.

“Say it yourself. Right now.”

“…Understood. I swear it on my name.”

“What name do you have worth staking? Swear it in the name of the Zhongnan Sect.”

“Grrk… Understood.”

Only then did a satisfied smile appear at the corners of Jeok Cheongang’s mouth. He laughed heartily and patted the Roaring Fury Swordsman on the shoulder.

“Where did a young bastard like you learn to grind your teeth like that? Should I just yank every last one of them out?”

“…”

“Hahahaha! This old man is old, so I can’t do that in front of all these people. Hahahaha!”

It was the first time I had learned that the laughter of a white-haired old man could be so frightening.

Everyone listening flinched at once—not only the Roaring Fury Swordsman.

Jeok Cheongang, who had been laughing like an evil spirit, turned his head toward me.

“You’re not blameless, either. No matter the circumstances, how could you hurl such abuse at an elder far above you in age? Are you out of your mind?”

I immediately bowed my head. Regardless of what had happened, facts were facts, and I also thought it was time to bring things to an end with the Roaring Fury Swordsman, an Elder of the Zhongnan Sect.

“I’m sorry.”

“Even if he ate his age through his asshole, he’s over sixty. It wouldn’t be strange for him to have a grandchild your age.”

“…Ah. Yes.”

“No matter how much of a bastard he is, he’s still an elder and a great Senior of Murim. It may be dirty and unfair, but from now on, show him the proper respect.”

“Great Hero Song. I sincerely apologize.”

When I straightened from my deep bow, I saw the Roaring Fury Swordsman’s face, red with anger.

Even after receiving my apology, he probably didn’t feel as though he had received one.

Meanwhile, despite apologizing to someone I disliked, I felt refreshed, as though I had just circulated my qi.

*Is this what comes with age?*

Take a look at that verbal skill forged over a hundred years.

He wasn’t just a Supreme Peak master in martial arts. At this point, he could change his title from Fire King to Tongue King.

After completing every step of the settlement under his supervision, the Tongue King announced in a solemn voice,

“All right. Now all the uninvited guests can get the hell out. If you’re hungry, have a bowl of rice before you go.”

He was treating them like beggars now.

The Roaring Fury Swordsman trembled with humiliation, then finally opened his mouth after a long while.

“…Then we will take our leave.”

“I won’t see you out.”

“Let’s go!”

As though he had been waiting for those words, the Roaring Fury Swordsman turned sharply around. Gong Ilhyuk and the other two members of the Three Hands of Zhongnan, who had been making all kinds of ugly faces, followed him.

Scorching gazes pursued the backs of the four men. Just before stepping through the main gate, the Roaring Fury Swordsman suddenly turned his head and stared at me.

A line of Sound Transmission filled with killing intent accompanied his words.

— I don’t know what connection you have to that old man… but as long as I’m alive, I will definitely punish you and the Jin Family of Taiyuan.

It happened in a moment brief enough to be called an instant.

As the Fire King watched the Roaring Fury Swordsman’s back disappear into the darkness with an unreadable expression, he tossed out a single remark.

“I’ll step out for a while.”

“Yes? Where are you going?”

“At my age, do I need to report every time I go relieve myself?”

He gruffly disappeared with a bowlegged gait.

* * *

Once the Roaring Fury Swordsman had moved a good distance away from the Jin Family of Taiyuan, he suddenly drew his sword and swung it.

Whoosh! Boom!

Dozens of streams of Sword Energy cut through trees and smashed rocks. After raging for quite some time, he finally turned his fury toward the Three Hands of Zhongnan, including Gong Ilhyuk.

“You bunch of idiots…”

“E-Elder.”

“Do you know what kind of humiliation this old man suffered because of you?”

“I-I’m sorry. Please forgive your foolish Disciple.”

The Three Hands of Zhongnan froze.

Gong Ilhyuk was especially terrified. If he had not incited the Roaring Fury Swordsman to come to the Jin Family of Taiyuan, none of this would have happened.

“E-Elder, please calm down and listen to me.”

“I let things slide a few times because you’re related to my Junior Brother, the Sect Leader, and now it seems you’ve forgotten your place.”

Crack!

The Roaring Fury Swordsman’s emaciated hand clamped around Gong Ilhyuk’s neck.

“Guh… I-I’m the Sect Leader’s…”

“Do you think my junior brother, the Sect Leader, would bat an eye if this old man punished one of you? You worthless piece of trash.”

Gong Ilhyuk’s face went deathly white.

Then—

Thump. Thump. Thud.

His body went limp, his head lolling to one side. The other two members of the Three Hands, who had been frozen with terror, also collapsed helplessly where they stood.

“W-why did these bastards suddenly…”

The Roaring Fury Swordsman, briefly confused, turned his head. He stared intently into the darkness before speaking.

“Do you still have business here?”

“Why else would I have come looking for you?”

Along with that calm voice, an old man of small stature appeared.

The Fire King, Jeok Cheongang.

He clicked his tongue as he looked at the fallen Three Hands of Zhongnan.

“Tsk, tsk. It seems I ended up saving those bastards by accident. Perhaps I should have come a little later.”

“Why have you come back?”

“It’s been a long time. I didn’t want to send you away just like that.”

The Fire King smiled faintly and added,

“There was also something I forgot.”

“Something you forgot? What do you mean…”

At that moment, Jeok Cheongang’s figure vanished like a phantom.

At the same time, Sword Energy erupted from the Roaring Fury Swordsman’s waist.

Sshh-shh-shh-shh-shk!

A dense net of Sword Energy spread across a three-jang radius, slicing through bone and flesh the instant it touched them.

But the big fish had already swum upstream.

“I told you earlier. Don’t touch even a single hair on that boy.”

Crack!

The hilt fell from the Roaring Fury Swordsman’s grip. His wrist broken, he screamed and drove his knee upward.

“Gyaaah! You fucking old bastard!”

“When will you finally become a proper human being?”

At the same time, a palm engulfed in pure-white flames pressed against the Roaring Fury Swordsman’s chest.

Boom!

“Guh…!”

An unavoidable palm strike.

His Body-Protecting Qi shattered, and his flesh and bones began to cook. Blood burst from his mouth as he fell to his knees, his eyelids trembling.

“Cough… F-Flame Divine Palm…”

“Raise your head and look at me.”

The old man’s voice was so cold that it made the title Fire King seem meaningless.

The Roaring Fury Swordsman barely managed to lift his head—and met a pair of eyes in which blue ghost flames flickered.

“F-Fire King.”

“That’s right. This old man is the Fire King.”

The Roaring Fury Swordsman had briefly forgotten just what kind of monster the Fire King, Jeok Cheongang, truly was.

Jeok Cheongang had been active in Murim for only a single year in his entire life. Yet with a single battle, he had become a legend and carved his mark into Murim history.

He was an opponent the Roaring Fury Swordsman could never stand against.

Deep despair settled over the Roaring Fury Swordsman’s face.

“Are you… are you planning to kill me?”

“If killing you would have ended everything, this old man would have done it long ago.”

“Then…”

“Remember one thing.”

The Fire King slowly parted his lips.

“You may kill Jin Taekyung. Even if you wipe out the Jin Family of Taiyuan, I will stand by and watch. But if that happens, I will go to the Zhongnan Sect.”

“……!”

“I will smash the Zhongnan Sect’s signboard and burn down Mount Zhongnan. If you abandon your main sect and flee, I will chase you to the ends of the earth and kill every last one of you. I will do so until the day my breath stops.”

The Roaring Fury Swordsman’s entire body trembled beneath the terrifying killing intent.

Everything Jeok Cheongang was saying was sincere. He was declaring that he would face the Zhongnan Sect alone.

If such a thing happened, it was impossible to imagine how many sacrifices would be required.

“What… what am I supposed to do?”

“The choice is yours. The punishment for it belongs to this old man.”

Jeok Cheongang left those words behind and vanished without a trace.

It was a long while before the Three Hands of Zhongnan finally woke. They were startled to find the Roaring Fury Swordsman sitting there in a daze.

“E-Elder!”

“What happened?”

“Who in the world did this?”

The Roaring Fury Swordsman opened his mouth only after a very long time.

“We’re going back. To Zhongnan.”

There was terror and fear in his voice, and the Three Hands of Zhongnan could say nothing.
