“노부가 네놈의 스승이면 안 되냐고.”

“예?”

아니, 이게 뭔 소리야. 얼핏 들으면 로맨스 드라마 남주 저리 가라다.

나는 주요 부위를 가리며 슬금슬금 뒤로 물러섰다.

“뭐냐?”

“아, 아닙니다. 그런데 무슨 말씀이세요?”

“됐다. 못 들은 셈 치거라.”

적천강의 표정은 오묘했다. 왠지 모를 은근한 기대와 짜증, 실망이 뒤섞인 얼굴로 날 바라보던 그가 불쑥 입을 열었다.

“네 녀석은 천무지체다.”

“천무, 뭐요?”

내 반응에 적천강이 눈살을 찌푸렸다.

“천무지체를 모른다니, 노부를 상대로 장난치는 것이냐?”

“머리털 나고 처음 듣는데요.”

“……하늘도 무심하지. 어찌 이런 놈에게.”

진짜 한 대 치고 싶은 표정이다.

술병을 움켜쥔 채 부르르 떨던 적천강이 한숨을 내쉬었다.

“하면 구음절맥(九陰絶脈)에 관해서는 아는 바가 있느냐?”

“아, 구음절맥. 알죠.”

예전에 많이 봤었는데. 이게 맞나?

나는 옛 기억을 더듬어 구음절맥에 관한 키워드 몇 개를 꺼내 들었다.

“특이체질. 아프다. 머리 좋다. 그 대신 요절.”

“…….”

“아닙니까?”

“……핵심은 맞다. 선천적으로 타고난 강한 음기가 혈맥을 틀어막고 이내 죽음에 이르게 되는 절맥증의 일종이지.”

“그럼 천무지체는요?”

갑자기 가슴 한구석에서 불안함이 스멀스멀 피어오른다. 앞서 구음절맥을 예시로 들었기 때문에 더욱 그랬다.

무공을 빠르게 익힐 수 있는 대신 몸에 어떤 문제가 있어서 요절하는 뭐 그런 거라면 큰일 아닌가.

적천강이 진중한 얼굴로 입을 열었다.

“천무지체는 수백 년에 한 번 나올까 말까 한, 그야말로 하늘이 내린 무골(武骨)이다.”

하늘이 내린 근골이라니. 듣기만 해도 엄청 좋아 보이는데.

그래서 더 떨린다. 구음절맥도 천재적인 지능과 수명을 맞바꾼 양날의 검이나 다름없으니까.

나는 긴장 어린 눈빛으로 적천강의 입을 응시했다.

“그리고요?”

“그리고라니?”

“전 언제 죽는 겁니까.”

“네놈이 죽긴 왜 죽어?”

“사실 요즘 머리가 아프고 속이 울렁거렸던 것 같아요. 지금도 뼈마디가 쑤시고요.”

내 말을 들은 닥터 최태, 아니 적천강은 짧고 간결한 진단을 내렸다.

“그건 노부에게 맞아서다.”

“아.”

“혹시 천무지체가 구음절맥처럼 요절한다는 그런 허무맹랑한 생각을 한 것은 아니겠지?”

“……커흠.”

“이런 정신 나간 놈을 봤나.”

적천강이 기가 찬다는 얼굴로 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다.

“천무지체는 구음절맥 같은 절맥증과는 하늘과 땅만큼의 차이가 있다. 괜히 하늘이 내렸다고 하겠느냐? 네 녀석은 그 몸뚱어리로 태어난 것부터가 천운(天運)을 타고난 것이다.”

“제가요?”

“노부가 소가주에게 듣기로는 네가 무공을 본격적으로 익힌 지 석 달이라고 하더군. 지금까지의 성취가 정녕 노력만으로 가능하다고 생각하느냐?”

“그건 아니죠.”

“어떤 무공도 누구보다 빠르게 네 것으로 체득할 수 있는 근골이 있기 때문에 지금의 네가 있는 것이다.”

적천강의 말은 딱 절반만 맞았다.

굳이 말하지 않는 이유는 노력에 더해진 것이 타고난 근골이 아니라 시스템이기 때문이다.

‘정말 천무지체였다면 약관이 될 때까지 삼류에 머물렀을 리가 없지.’

될성부른 나무는 싹수부터 다르다.

이 몸의 전 주인이었던 진짜 진태경이 그런 천운을 타고났다면 진작 두각을 드러냈을 것이 분명하다.

‘이 몸은 천무지체가 아니야.’

나는 두 손을 내려다보았다. 팔과 손의 크기와 길이, 근육의 모양과 그 안에 숨겨진 힘.

그 모든 것이 한 치의 오차 없이 균등하다.

‘시스템.’

레벨 업과 수련으로 얻은 포인트는 능력치로 환산된다. 그리고 시스템은 그 능력치를 골고루 분배한다.

아주 작고 미세한 신체 내부의 톱니바퀴 하나하나가 완벽하게 맞물리도록.

‘선천적인 것이 아니니까 그냥 천무지체는 아니고…… 이 정도면 후천적 천무지체 정도는 되려나?’

내 몸을 직접 본 적이 있는 적천강이 착각하는 것도 무리는 아니다.

또한 내 입장에서도 그가 지금처럼 착각하도록 내버려 두는 편이 좋았다.

술이나 퍼먹던 삼류 망나니가 절정 고수가 되기까지 걸린 시간이 고작 석 달.

천무지체가 아니면 마공(魔功)으로 몰려도 이상하지 않다.

‘여하튼 잘됐네.’

초절정 고수인 적천강이 천무지체로 착각할 정도니 내 근골이 매우 뛰어나다는 사실은 의심의 여지가 없다.

구음절맥 같은 부작용도 없으니 그야말로 땡큐다.

‘드디어 꽃길인가.’

지금까지 했던 고생을 생각하니 눈물이 앞을 가린다.

감상에 빠져 있던 나는 문득 느껴지는 시선에 고개를 돌렸다.

갑자기 눈이 마주친 적천강이 움찔하더니 멀거니 하늘을 바라보았다.

“다, 달이 밝군.”

그의 시선을 따라 하늘을 올려다본 내가 중얼거렸다.

“먹구름 잔뜩 끼었는데요.”

“…….”

“뭐 하실 말씀 있으세요?”

“커흐흠.”

헛기침만 연발하던 적천강이 슬그머니 입을 열었다.

“알다시피 노부는 네게 갚을 빚이 있다.”

“그래서요?”

“이곳을 떠나기 전에 그 문제를 확실히 해 두고 싶어서 묻는 것인데, 혹시 노부에게 원하는 것이 있느냐?”

사실 딱히 없다.

굳이 하나 있다면 아까 전의 발언을 취소해 달라는 정도?

하지만 체면상 적천강이 그렇게 할 가능성은 없을 거다. 합리적인 선에서 그가 들어줄 만한 부탁을 제시해야 하는데…….

나는 머리를 긁적였다.

“글쎄요. 구체적으로 생각해 보지를 않아서 잘.”

“그럼 구체적으로 생각해 보거라.”

“아, 생각나면 나중에 말씀드릴게요. 어차피 떠나시려면 며칠 더 있으셔야 하니까.”

하지만 적천강은 단호했다.

“지금 당장.”

“예?”

“지금 당장 말하란 말이다. 별로 고민할 것도 없지 않느냐.”

나를 재촉하던 적천강이 웅얼거리는 목소리로 덧붙였다.

“예, 예를 들면 노부에게 무공을 배우고 싶다든지. 무공을 배우고 싶다든지. 무공을 배우고 싶다든지. 뭐 그런 게 있지 않겠느냐.”

“…….”

“어디까지나 예를 든 것뿐이다. 신경 쓰지 말거라.”

“…….”

“크흠. 목에 가래가 끼었나. 커흐흠!”

그 모습을 가만히 지켜보던 내가 입을 열었다.

“적 대협. 혹시나 해서 여쭤보는 건데요.”

“커흐흐흐흠!”

“절 제자로 삼고 싶으신 겁니까?”

그 순간, 요란하게 기침을 내뱉던 적천강의 신형이 우뚝 굳었다. 동시에 그의 동공이 지진이라도 난 것처럼 흔들린다.

“무, 무슨 소리냐!”

“들으신 그대론데요.”

“허, 허참. 어처구니가 없군. 노부가 네 녀석을 제자로 들이고 싶어 해?”

“…….”

응. 엄청 그렇게 보이는데.

처음엔 착각인가 싶었는데, 이쯤 되면 모르는 게 병신인 수준이다.

내가 말없이 바라보기만 하자 도리어 당황한 것은 적천강이었다.

“이, 이놈! 그 불손한 눈빛은 무엇이냐!”

“그냥 보는 겁니다. 신경 쓰지 마세요.”

“뭔가 단단히 착각하는 모양인데, 전부 틀렸다.”

“아, 예.”

“유구한 역사를 간직한 본문의 계승자를 그리 쉽게 결정할 것 같더냐?”

“아까는 되게 쉽게 결정하시던데. 그 많은 사람 앞에서 한 말이니까 물리지도 못하잖습니까.”

“그, 그건. 새로운 제자를 들이면 된다.”

“일인전승 비인부전이라면서요? 그래 봤자 세상 사람들은 제가 열화문의 계승자라고 생각할걸요.”

정곡을 찔린 적천강이 빽 소리쳤다.

“네놈을 제자로 삼을 이유가 하나도 없어!”

“저 천무지체인데요.”

“헉.”

“삼류에서 절정까지 석 달 정도니까 초절정까지는 얼마나 걸리려나.”

“이, 이놈이. 그게 그리 쉬운 줄 아느냐? 초절정이 뉘 집 개 이름이야?”

“전 쉽던데.”

“…….”

죽을 고비를 몇 번이나 넘겼더라.

더럽게 어렵고 힘들었지만 지금부터는 무조건 쉬운 거다.

말문이 막힌 적천강에게 내가 혼잣말처럼 중얼거렸다.

“아니다, 초절정이면 어렵긴 하겠구나.”

“무, 물론이지.”

“서른 살 정도면 되려나?”

적천강이 입을 딱 벌렸다.

“이, 이립? 초절정을?”

“아, 너무 길게 잡았나요? 어려울 것 같아서 일부러 그런 건데.”

나는 적천강을 곁눈질하며 한숨을 내쉬었다.

“하긴 적 대협은 십왕에 들어갈 만큼 고수시니까 저와는 비교도 안 되게 빠르셨겠죠. 거기에 열화문의 무공까지. 와, 부럽다. 나도 저런 상승무공을 익히면 금방 강해질 텐데.”

“……!”

적천강이 떨리는 눈으로 나를 바라봤다. 그의 머릿속에서 어떤 상상이 펼쳐지고 있는지 충분히 예상이 간다.

천무지체와 열화문의 신공절학이 만난다면 무슨 일이 일어날까.

고작 석 달 만에 믿을 수 없는 성취를 보여 준 나다. 고금을 통틀어 유례없는 괴물이 탄생할 수도 있다.

‘거의 끝났군.’

차마 자존심이 있어 말은 못 하고 머뭇거리는 그에게 쐐기를 박았다.

“에이, 안 되겠다. 저도 이번 회합이 끝나면 화산파에 가 보려고요.”

“화, 화산파? 거긴 왜?”

“검성 매종학 대협 때문에요. 들어 보니 두 분이 꽤 친하다고 하더라고요? 사정을 잘 말씀드리면 소문 안 나게 제자로 들어갈 수 있을 것 같…….”

“안 돼!”

자신도 모르게 튀어나온 외침. 흠칫한 적천강이 마른침을 꼴깍 삼켰다.

“호, 혹시 생각이 있다면…….”

“예? 목소리가 작아서 안 들려요.”

“후우.”

숨을 가다듬은 적천강이 재차 말했다.

“혹시 생각이 있다면 옆에서 무공을 봐줄 수도 있다.”

나는 짐짓 놀란 듯이 눈을 크게 떴다.

“진심이십니까?”

“물론이다. 빚은 갚아야 하지 않겠느냐?”

뒤늦게 위엄을 세워야 한다고 생각했는지 지금까지와는 다른 준엄한 목소리다.

‘그래 봤자 이미 늦었어, 이 양반아.’

난 간신히 웃음을 참으며 대답했다.

“지금까지 해 주신 것만으로도 충분한데요.”

“빚은 열 배, 스무 배로 갚는 것이 노부의 철칙이니라.”

“그렇군요.”

“그렇지.”

“그런데 어차피 며칠 후면 떠나시지 않나요? 많이 바쁘신 것 같던데.”

“뒤로 미뤄도 된다. 네가 어느 정도 성취를 거두면 그때 떠날 계획이다.”

“아, 한 번 시작하면 끝을 보시는 성격이군요.”

“타고난 천성이지.”

“만약 제가 적 대협께서 원하시는 성취에 도달하지 못하면 어떡합니까?”

적천강이 짐짓 얼굴을 굳혔다.

“어허, 이놈! 어찌 벌써부터 안 될 거라 생각하느냐!”

“죄송합니다. 몇 년이 걸릴지도 몰라서요.”

“노부가 어떤 성격인지 방금 말해 놓고도 잊었느냐?”

“한번 시작하면 끝장을 보시는?”

“무인이 한 번 검을 뽑았으면 산이라도 썰어야지.”

“이야, 멋지십니다. 역시 적 대협!”

엄지를 치켜세워 준 내가 은근한 목소리로 물었다.

“그런데 이 정도면 사제지간 아닙니까?”

“……!”

잠깐 침묵하던 적천강이 세차게 고개를 저었다.

“사제지간이라니, 허튼 소리! 단지 빚을 갚는 것뿐이다.”

“아아, 그렇군요. 제가 적 대협의 뜻을 오해했네요. 정중하게 사죄드립니다.”

“……크흠.”

불편한 헛기침을 내뱉은 적천강이 말했다.

“다만 호칭은 바꿔야 할 것 같다.”

“호칭 말입니까?”

“비록 우리가 그, 진짜 사제지간은 아니지만, 사람들 눈이 있으니 구색은 맞춰야 하지 않겠느냐?”

“그렇긴 하네요.”

호칭이라. 뭐라고 부르는 게 좋을까?

짧은 생각 끝에 한 단어가 튀어나왔다.

“그럼 앞으로 사부님이라고 부르면 되겠습니까?”

“…….”

“사부님?”

“으, 응?”

막 잠에서 깬 것처럼 정신을 차린 적천강이 복잡 미묘한 눈빛으로 나를 바라봤다.

“그래, 그게 좋겠구나.”

“예. 그럼 단둘이 있을 때는…….”

“노야(老爺). 그렇게 불러라.”

“알겠습니다. 노야.”

나는 그를 향해 깊이 고개를 숙여 보였다.

천하에 명성이 자자한 초절정 고수, 화왕 적천강.

그와의 미묘한 관계가 시작되는 순간이었다.



* * *



진태경을 돌려보낸 적천강은 낡은 담벼락에 등을 기댔다.

머릿속에서는 방금 전 들었던 목소리가 끊임없이 울려 퍼지고 있었다.

‘사부님이라.’

십 년 만이다.

누군가 자신을 사부라고 불러 준 것은.

체격도, 얼굴도, 성격도 달랐지만 그는 진태경의 모습에서 죽은 제자를 떠올렸다.

가만히 생각에 잠긴 적천강의 주름진 입가에, 문득 엷은 미소가 떠올랐다.

‘나쁘지 않군.’

이렇게 되리라고는 생각지도 못했지만 그의 기분은 나쁘지 않았다.

아니, 오히려 앞날에 대한 기대와 이유 모를 유쾌함마저 들었다.

“나쁘지 않아. 정말로.”

적천강은 피식 웃으며 하늘을 올려다봤다.

어느샌가 먹구름이 걷히고 환한 달이 모습을 드러내고 있었다.

# Chapter 200

“I asked whether this old man couldn’t be your master.”

“Pardon?”

What the hell was he talking about? Taken out of context, that line could put a romance-drama male lead to shame.

I covered my vital areas and slowly backed away.

“What?”

“N-Nothing. But what do you mean?”

“Forget it. Pretend you never heard me.”

Jeok Cheongang’s expression was strange. He stared at me with a face that mixed inexplicable expectation, irritation, and disappointment, then suddenly opened his mouth.

“You possess the Heavenly Martial Physique.”

“Heavenly Martial what?”

Jeok Cheongang frowned at my reaction.

“You don’t know about the Heavenly Martial Physique? Are you making fun of this old man?”

“I’m hearing it for the first time in my life.”

“…”

*Heaven truly is heartless. How could it give such a thing to someone like this?*

He looked like he genuinely wanted to hit me.

Jeok Cheongang trembled as he clutched his liquor bottle, then let out a sigh.

“Then do you know anything about the Nine Yin Severed Meridians?”

“Oh, the Nine Yin Severed Meridians. I know about that.”

I had seen it plenty of times in the past. Was this the same thing?

I rummaged through my old memories and pulled out a few keywords related to the Nine Yin Severed Meridians.

“An unusual constitution. Painful. Intelligent. Dies young instead.”

“…”

“Am I wrong?”

“You have the gist of it. It is a type of severed-meridian condition in which powerful innate yin energy blocks the meridians and leads to death before long.”

“Then what about the Heavenly Martial Physique?”

A sense of unease began creeping up from somewhere in my chest. The fact that he had used the Nine Yin Severed Meridians as an example made it worse.

*What if it lets me learn martial arts quickly, but I have some problem that makes me die young? That would be a disaster.*

Jeok Cheongang spoke with a solemn expression.

“The Heavenly Martial Physique is a martial constitution bestowed by Heaven, one that appears perhaps once every several hundred years.”

*Bones and muscles bestowed by Heaven?* It sounded incredible just hearing about it.

Which only made me more nervous. The Nine Yin Severed Meridians were practically a double-edged sword that traded genius-level intelligence for a short lifespan.

I stared tensely at Jeok Cheongang’s mouth.

“And?”

“What do you mean, ‘and’?”

“When am I going to die?”

“Why would you die?”

“I think I’ve been having headaches and feeling nauseous lately. My bones and joints ache even now.”

Doctor Choi Tae—no, Jeok Cheongang—gave me a short and concise diagnosis.

“That’s because this old man beat you.”

“Oh.”

“You didn’t seriously think the Heavenly Martial Physique caused you to die young like the Nine Yin Severed Meridians, did you?”

“…”

“Have you lost your mind?”

Jeok Cheongang shook his head in disbelief.

“The Heavenly Martial Physique and a severed-meridian illness like the Nine Yin Severed Meridians are as different as Heaven and Earth. Do you think it’s called something bestowed by Heaven for no reason? You were born with that body in the first place. You were born blessed by heavenly fortune.”

“Me?”

“I heard from the Lesser Family Head that you’ve only been seriously learning martial arts for three months. Do you truly think your achievements so far would have been possible through effort alone?”

“Not really.”

“You are where you are because you possess a constitution that lets you make any martial art your own faster than anyone else.”

Jeok Cheongang was only half right.

The reason I didn’t bother correcting him was that what had been added to my effort wasn’t an innate constitution. It was the System.

*If I really possessed the Heavenly Martial Physique, I wouldn’t have remained Third Rate until I reached twenty.*

A promising tree showed its potential from the very beginning.

If the real Jin Taekyung—the previous owner of this body—had been born with such heavenly fortune, he would surely have distinguished himself long ago.

*This body doesn’t possess the Heavenly Martial Physique.*

I looked down at both my hands. The size and length of my arms and hands, the shape of my muscles, and the strength hidden within them.

Everything was perfectly balanced, without the slightest deviation.

*The System.*

The points I gained from leveling up and training were converted into stats. And the System distributed those stats evenly.

It ensured that every tiny gear inside my body, down to the smallest and most delicate one, meshed together perfectly.

*Since it isn’t innate, it isn’t exactly the Heavenly Martial Physique… But at this level, could I call it an acquired Heavenly Martial Physique?*

Jeok Cheongang had seen my body with his own eyes, so it wasn’t strange that he had mistaken it for one.

And from my perspective, it was better to let him continue making that mistake.

It had taken only three months for a Third Rate wastrel who did nothing but drink to become a Peak master.

Without the Heavenly Martial Physique, people might reasonably suspect me of practicing demonic arts.

*Either way, this worked out nicely.*

The fact that even a Supreme Peak master like Jeok Cheongang could mistake my constitution for the Heavenly Martial Physique proved beyond doubt that my bones and muscles were exceptional.

And since I had none of the side effects associated with the Nine Yin Severed Meridians, it was a complete win.

*Is my path finally paved with flowers?*

When I thought about everything I had suffered until now, tears welled up in my eyes.

I was lost in my emotions when I suddenly felt someone’s gaze and turned my head.

Jeok Cheongang flinched when our eyes met, then abruptly looked up at the sky.

“T-The moon is bright.”

I followed his gaze and mumbled:

“There are thick clouds covering it.”

“…”

“Did you have something to say?”

“Cough. Ahem.”

After clearing his throat several times, Jeok Cheongang cautiously opened his mouth.

“As you know, this old man owes you a debt.”

“So?”

“I’m asking because I want to settle the matter properly before leaving this place. Is there anything you want from this old man?”

Actually, there wasn’t anything in particular.

If I had to name one thing, it would be for him to take back what he had said earlier.

But there was no chance Jeok Cheongang would do that for the sake of his dignity. I had to come up with a request he could reasonably fulfill.

I scratched my head.

“Well, I haven’t really thought about it in detail, so I’m not sure.”

“Then think about it in detail.”

“Oh, I’ll tell you later if I think of something. You’ll have to stay a few more days before you leave anyway.”

But Jeok Cheongang was firm.

“Right now.”

“Pardon?”

“I’m telling you to say it right now. There’s nothing to think about, is there?”

As he urged me, Jeok Cheongang added in a mumbling voice:

“For example, perhaps you want to learn martial arts from this old man. Or maybe you want to learn martial arts from this old man. Or you might want to learn martial arts from this old man. Something like that.”

“…”

“It was only an example. Don’t concern yourself with it.”

“…”

“Ahem. Is there phlegm stuck in my throat? Ahem!”

I watched him quietly before opening my mouth.

“Great Hero Jeok. I’m asking just in case.”

“Ahem! Ahem!”

“Do you want to take me as your Disciple?”

At that moment, Jeok Cheongang’s body froze in the middle of his loud coughing fit. His pupils shook as though an earthquake had struck them.

“W-What are you talking about?”

“You heard me.”

“H-How absurd. You think this old man wants to take you as his Disciple?”

“…”

*Yes. It really looks that way.*

At first, I wondered if I was imagining it, but by this point, anyone who still didn’t get it would have to be a fucking idiot.

When I merely stared at him without saying anything, Jeok Cheongang became flustered instead.

“You little bastard! What is that insolent look in your eyes?”

“I’m just looking at you. Don’t worry about it.”

“You seem to be laboring under some serious misconception, but you’re wrong about everything.”

“Ah. Yes.”

“Do you think I would decide so easily on the successor to our sect’s lineage, which carries a long and venerable history?”

“You decided pretty easily earlier. And you said it in front of all those people, so you can’t take it back.”

“Th-That… I can simply take another Disciple.”

“You said it was a single-successor, no-outside-transmission tradition, didn’t you? Regardless, everyone in the world will think I’m the successor to the Fire Gate Clan.”

Jeok Cheongang had been struck right in the heart of the matter. He shouted:

“There isn’t a single reason for me to take you as my Disciple!”

“I possess the Heavenly Martial Physique.”

“Gasp.”

“It took me about three months to go from Third Rate to Peak. I wonder how long it’ll take me to reach Supreme Peak.”

“Y-You bastard. Do you think it’s that easy? Do you think Supreme Peak is some mutt’s name?”

“It was easy for me.”

“…”

How many times had I crossed the threshold of death?

It had been brutally difficult and painful, but from this point onward, it was going to be easy no matter what.

While Jeok Cheongang struggled to find words, I mumbled as though speaking to myself:

“Actually, Supreme Peak might be difficult.”

“Of course it is.”

“Would around thirty work?”

Jeok Cheongang’s mouth fell open.

“Th-Thirty? Supreme Peak?”

“Ah, did I set the goal too far away? I only said that because it seemed difficult.”

I sighed as I glanced sideways at him.

“Still, you must have been much faster than me, Great Hero Jeok. You’re powerful enough to rank among the Ten Kings, after all. And you had the Fire Gate Clan’s martial arts, too. Wow, I’m jealous. If I learned advanced martial arts like those, I’d become strong in no time.”

“!”

Jeok Cheongang stared at me with trembling eyes. I could easily imagine what sort of scene was unfolding in his mind.

*What would happen if the Heavenly Martial Physique met the Fire Gate Clan’s supreme martial arts?*

I had already displayed unbelievable achievements in only three months. It was possible that an unprecedented monster, unlike anything seen in history, would be born.

*I’m almost there.*

Unable to speak because of his pride, Jeok Cheongang hesitated. I drove in the final nail.

“Actually, this won’t do. I’m thinking of visiting Huashan once this gathering ends.”

“Huashan? Why would you go there?”

“Because of Great Hero Sword Saint Mae Jonghak. I hear the two of you are quite close, so if I explain my circumstances properly, I might be able to become his Disciple without letting the rumor spread…”

“No!”

The shout burst out before Jeok Cheongang could stop it. He flinched and swallowed dryly.

“If you happen to be considering that…”

“Pardon? I can’t hear you. You’re speaking too quietly.”

“Hoo.”

After steadying his breath, Jeok Cheongang spoke again.

“If you’re interested, this old man could personally oversee your martial arts training.”

I widened my eyes as though genuinely surprised.

“Are you serious?”

“Of course. A debt must be repaid, mustn’t it?”

Perhaps he had belatedly decided that he needed to maintain his dignity. His voice was more stern than it had been until now.

*It’s too late for that, old man.*

I barely held back a laugh and answered:

“What you’ve already done is more than enough.”

“It is this old man’s principle to repay a debt tenfold, even twentyfold.”

“I see.”

“Exactly.”

“But aren’t you leaving in a few days anyway? You seem very busy.”

“It can be postponed. I plan to leave once you have achieved a certain level of progress.”

“Ah, so you’re the type who sees things through once you start.”

“It’s simply my nature.”

“What if I fail to achieve the level of progress you want, Great Hero Jeok?”

Jeok Cheongang deliberately hardened his expression.

“Hey, you little bastard! How can you decide in advance that you’ll fail?”

“I’m sorry. I just don’t know how many years it might take.”

“Did you already forget what sort of person I said I was?”

“The type who sees things through once you start?”

“Once a martial artist draws his sword, he should see it through—even if he has to cut down a mountain.”

“Wow, that’s amazing. As expected of you, Great Hero Jeok!”

I gave him a thumbs-up and asked in a suggestive voice:

“But at this point, doesn’t that make us master and Disciple?”

“!”

After a brief silence, Jeok Cheongang vigorously shook his head.

“Master and Disciple? What nonsense! I’m merely repaying a debt.”

“Oh, I see. I misunderstood your intentions, Great Hero Jeok. Please accept my sincere apologies.”

“…”

Jeok Cheongang gave an uncomfortable cough before speaking.

“But I think we need to change the way you address me.”

“The way I address you?”

“Although we are not, well, truly master and Disciple, there are people watching. Shouldn’t we at least make it look right?”

“That’s true.”

*The way I address him? What should I call him?*

After a brief moment of thought, one word slipped from my mouth.

“Then should I call you Master from now on?”

“…”

“Master?”

“H-Huh?”

Jeok Cheongang came to his senses as though he had just woken up and stared at me with a complicated, subtle gaze.

“Yes. That would be good.”

“Yes. Then when it’s just the two of us…”

“Old Master. Call me that.”

“Understood. Old Master.”

I bowed deeply toward him.

The Supreme Peak master whose fame resounded throughout the world, Fire King Jeok Cheongang.

It was the moment my subtle relationship with him began.

* * *

After sending Jin Taekyung back, Jeok Cheongang leaned against an old wall.

The voice he had just heard continued to echo inside his head.

*Master.*

It had been ten years.

Ten years since someone had called him Master.

Jin Taekyung’s build, face, and personality were all different, but Jeok Cheongang was reminded of his dead Disciple when he looked at him.

As Jeok Cheongang quietly sank into thought, a faint smile suddenly appeared at the corner of his wrinkled mouth.

*Not bad.*

He had never imagined things would turn out this way, but he didn’t feel bad about it.

No, he even felt an expectation for the future and an inexplicable sense of cheerfulness.

“Not bad. Truly.”

Jeok Cheongang gave a quiet laugh and looked up at the sky.

At some point, the clouds had cleared, revealing a bright moon.
