# Durable State Update — Chapter 332

Return exactly one JSON object and no Markdown fence. Record only facts established
by this chapter. Do not use tools, edit prose, infer future events, or copy archived
profile continuity. Profile updates are maintenance, not chapter recaps: replace
existing fields to remove resolved events, stale travel/combat narration, and
duplicated facts. Preserve only stable identity, role, personality, voice,
relationships, and currently active unresolved/status facts. If a previous
detail no longer helps translate a future chapter, delete it. Never add a fact
merely because it appeared in the reading copy.

`context` must contain exactly the durable context schema shown below, with version
1 and safe_through 332. Keep at most
2 continuity_sources. Keep
`active_continuity` to at most 12 concise items,
`open_questions` to at most 5 items, and
`temporary_decisions` to at most 5 items.
Keep the serialized context under 16384 UTF-8 bytes.
Use only chapter numbers through 332. Profile updates may replace only one
complete line in Aliases, Role, Personality, Voice, or Relationships. Do not
return Safe through updates; the controller sets that field automatically.
Each profile field should be one concise sentence; never append semicolon-separated
chapter history.
`names` contains only newly required Korean-to-English rows; Korean keys must occur
in the source. `address_pairs` contains only newly required speaker→addressee rows;
each Korean key must occur in the source or already appear in the address ledger,
and at least one endpoint must occur in the source (first-person narrators may be
ledger-only). Speaker and addressee must be Hangul source spellings (Arabic digits
allowed in titles such as 1팀장; do not romanize). Do not invent risk-register rows. Beat
plot paragraphs are plain strings; continuity and translation decisions are concise
list items.
Return this exact shape:

＃332화



“감히 어느 놈이 장강에서 행패를 부리느냐!”

저쪽에서 대답해줄 것 같지는 않은데.

무송의 외침을 한 귀로 흘려넘긴 나는 공력을 일으켜 안력(眼力)을 높였다.

족히 이백여 장은 떨어진 거리. 그러나 인간 독수리라고 불러도 될 만큼 향상된 시력은 모든 광경을 일목요연하게 담아냈다.

‘저건…….’

수적이다. 지금 우리가 타고 있는 쾌조선보다 훨씬 큰 선박 두 척이 자그마한 배 한 척을 에워싸고 있었고, 화살이며 작살처럼 보이는 검은 점들이 쉴 새 없이 날아드는 중이었다.

그리고 놈들이 탄 배에 휘날리는 깃발을 확인한 내 시선이 자연스럽게 무송을 향했다.

“어느 잡놈들인지는 몰라도 잘 걸렸다. 여봐라! 당장 저 근본 없는 놈들을…… 왜 그러나?”

“어, 선배님. 이게 참 뭐라고 말씀드려야 할지.”

“뭐가 말인가?”

“저 근본 없는 잡놈들. 장강수로맹 소속 같은데요?”

“……?”

“……?”

잠시 말이 없던 무송이 버럭 소리쳤다.

“그럴 리 없네!”

“아니 그럴 리 없는 게 아니라, 깃발에 장강수로맹이라고 아주 용맹한 글씨체로 쓰여 있어요.”

“자네, 조금 전에는 문맹이라고 하지 않았나?”

수적이 아니라 면도날인가. 의외로 예리한 면이 있다.

나는 당황하는 대신 얼굴을 굳히며 말했다.

“제가 좀 빨리 배우는 편입니다. 그리고 지금 그게 문젭니까? 촌각이라도 빨리 장강의 질서를 어지럽히는 저 무뢰배들을 처단해야죠!”

무송은 나부터 처단하고 싶은 표정이었지만, 내 의견에는 십분 공감했다.

“그렇지. 요즘 시대가 어느 때인데 감히 장강에서 살인을…… 내 저놈들을 일장에 쳐 죽이고 말리라!”

저게 수적 두령의 입에서 나온 말이라는 게 개탄스럽지만, 궁기방에게 슬쩍 들은 말에 의하면 무송은 장강수로맹 내에서도 온건파에 속하는 수적이었다.

돈만 뺏으면 됐지, 목숨은 뭐 하러 뺏냐는 것이 그의 지론이라는 것이다.

“…….”

아니, 결국 뺏는다는 거잖아.

생각해 보면 어째 그놈이 그놈 같긴 한데, 심심하면 칼부터 날리고 보는 무림에서 그것도 장강수로맹주의 제자씩이나 되는 1티어 수적치고는 양심적인 게 맞다.

“적기(赤旗)를 올려라!”

두목인 무송의 우렁찬 외침에, 전투를 의미하는 붉은 깃발을 내건 다섯 척의 쾌조선이 빠른 속도로 나아갔다.

쏴아아아아!

때마침 불어오는 바람에 팽팽하게 부풀어 오른 돛. 최고의 속도를 내기 위해 개조한 쾌조선은 거침없이 물살을 가르며 거리를 지워 나갔다.

이백 장의 거리가 순식간에 절반으로 좁혀졌을 때, 백병전을 시도하려던 수적들 사이에서 다급한 외침이 울려 퍼졌다.

“쾌, 쾌조선!”

“수룡채의 무송이 나타났다! 모두 후퇴하라!”

하지만 그것을 가만히 두고 볼 무송이 아니었다.

어느덧 적과의 거리는 불과 오십여 장. 황급히 자신들의 배로 돌아가는 무리를 노려보는 그의 눈동자에 기광이 번뜩였다.

“어느 놈들인지 낯짝이나 보자!”

빠드득, 이 가는 소리와 함께 거대한 작살을 잡아챈 무송이 선미를 박차고 뛰어 올랐다.

쾅!

단단한 목재 바닥이 부서짐과 동시에, 포물선을 그리며 쏘아진 무송의 신형을 장강이 거칠게 집어삼켰다.

‘저거 위험한 거 아닌가?’

장강을 강원도 계곡 정도로 보면 곤란하다.

비록 이곳이 본류(本流)에서 갈라진 장강의 한 줄기라고는 하나, 바다만큼이나 드넓고 수심이 깊은 데다가 물살 또한 거칠기 짝이 없었다.

오죽하면 헛구역질을 하던 혁무진까지 창백한 얼굴로 물어봤을까.

“저거 구해야 되는 거 아닙, 우웨에에엑!”

“기방아, 저 자식 등 좀 두드려 줘라.”

“내가 무슨 유모도 아니고…….”

당연히 유모는 아니지. 누가 거지를 유모로 써.

투덜거리면서도 혁무진의 등을 퍽퍽 두드린 궁기방이 말했다.

“그리고 무지해도 정도가 있지. 수적 두령이 수공(水功)도 익히지 않고 장강에 뛰어들었을 것 같으냐? 그것도 물에서는 당해 낼 자가 없다는 해상왕의 제자가?”

“아, 그러네.”

“어떤 놈들인지는 모르나 단단히 잘못 걸렸다. 오늘 줄초상 나겠군. 쯧쯧.”

궁기방의 예견은 정확했다.

수 초 후, 무송이 수면 위로 모습을 드러낸 것은 쾌조선보다 십여 장은 앞선 지점이었다.

촤아아악!

거대한 신형이 물결처럼 유연하게 곡선을 그릴 때마다 수상스키처럼 치고 나가는 걸 보니 저절로 입이 딱 벌어진다.

“이럴 수가!”

심지어 쾌조선보다 빠른 속도.

마치 어인(魚人)과도 같은 모습으로 선박을 향해 돌진하는 무송의 모습을 보고 있자니, 나까지 피가 끓어오른다.

“기왕 이렇게 된 거, 나도 간다!”

궁기방이 비명처럼 외쳤다.

“가긴 또 어딜 가!”

“우웨에에엑!”

“은인, 저도요!”

“다 꺼져! 위대한 항로가, 장강이 나를 부른다!”

버뮤다 삼각지대를 뿌리치며 갑판을 가로지른 나는, 뱃머리에서 온 힘을 다해 솟구쳤다.

쾅! 우지지직!

힘을 견디지 못하고 박살 난 뱃머리. 부유감에 휩싸인 몸과 맹렬하게 얼굴에 부딪히는 바람.

쐐애애애액!

“자유! 프리덤!”

나는 한 마리의 새가 되었고, 이내 힘을 잃고 추락했으며.

“선배님!”

“헉!”

타닥!

지나가던 어느 어인의 등에 사뿐히 안착했다.

각도와 속도, 거리 계산, 떨어지는 지점. 그 모든 것들이 정확했기에 나올 수 있는 결과였다.

“후우. 완-벽.”

“뭐가 완벽해!”

예상치 못한 무임승차에 무송은 고함을 내질렀지만, 이미 올라탄 걸 어쩌겠나.

나는 서둘러 뱃머리를 돌리고 있는 수적들을 노려보며 외쳤다.

“갑시다!”

“이런 제기랄! 이왕 이렇게 된 거, 선박까지 돌진한다!”

“그래, 그래야 내 선배님이지!”

“자네는 끝나고 보세!”

촤아아아악!

이를 악문 무송이 속력을 더욱 높였다.

이제 겨우 자리를 잡은 수적들이 황급히 자리를 벗어나려 했지만, 이미 늦었다.

우리는 한 자루의 작살이 되어 배의 옆면을 향해 쏘아지고 있었으니까.

“가라, 선배! 어인 유술 해류 한 팔 업어치기!”

“이야아아아!”

나와 무송은 목이 터져라 외치며 동시에 팔을 뻗었다.

그는 작살을, 나는 창을 쥐고 있었지만 한 가지 공통점이 있었다.

바로 그 끝에 맺힌 강대한 기운.

쐐애애애액!

바람을 베어 버리며 쇄도한 두 개의 창기(槍氣)가 축축하고 단단한 배의 옆면을 파고든 다음 순간.

꽈앙! 쿠구구궁!

엄청난 충격파와 함께 굉음이 울려 퍼졌다.



* * *



“무진아.”

내 진중한 목소리에 마침내 구역질을 멈춘 혁무진이 창백한 얼굴로 대답했다.

“예?”

“나 수적 체질인가 봐.”

“그건 또 무슨 헛소립니까.”

“곡소리 듣고 싶니?”

“제가 몸이 안 좋아서 그만 말실수를. 다시 생각해 보니까 잘 어울리시는 것 같습니다.”

“그렇지?”

“예. 무모, 아니 용맹하게 선박을 그대로 관통해 버리시던 모습이 지금도 눈에 훤합니다.”

“짜릿했지.”

나는 흐뭇하게 고개를 끄덕이며 서서히 침몰 중인 배를 바라보았다.

한쪽에서는 쾌조선에 실려 있던 조그마한 나룻배에 나눠 탄 무송의 수하들이 물에 빠져 허우적거리는 수적들을 건져 내고 있었고, 다른 한 척의 배에서는 고개를 푹 떨군 수적들이 줄줄이 밧줄에 묶인 채로 쾌조선에 옮겨 타고 있었다.

‘한 척은 침몰. 다른 한 척은 나포(拿捕).’

첫 수전(水戰)치고는 아주 훌륭한 전과다.

원래는 두 척 모두 침몰시킬 생각이었지만, 동료들이 탄 배가 침몰하는 광경을 보자마자 전의를 상실한 수적들이 항복해 왔기 때문에 어쩔 수 없었다.

물론 항복했다 하더라도, 결말은 그리 좋지 않았다.

“감히 네놈들 따위가 장강수로맹의 이름을 더럽혀?”

아무리 무송이 온건파니 뭐니 해도, 결국은 살인에 거리낌 없는 무림인이자 거친 장강에서 살아온 수적이다.

한 번 꼭지가 돌아 버린 무송은 거칠 것 없었다.

“물고기 밥으로 던져 줘라.”

꽁꽁 묶여 있던 수적들이 눈을 부릅떴다.

“이, 이럴 수는 없습니다!”

“채주! 제발 그것만은!”

그러나 그들에게 돌아온 것은 무송의 싸늘한 눈빛이었다.

“채주? 속해 있는 수채가 다르거늘, 내가 왜 네놈의 채주란 말이냐. 그리고 걱정하지 말거라. 네놈 두령도 곧 따라갈 테니 외롭지는 않을 것이다.”

“잘못했습니다! 제발 이번 한 번만……!”

“수룡채의 영역까지 침범해 가면서 이런 짓을 벌였다면 이 정도 각오는 했어야지. 굳이 너희를 건져 낸 이유가 무엇인지 아느냐? 내 손으로 직접 처벌을 내리기 위해서다.”

무송이 턱짓하자 그의 수하들이 다가와 수적들을 질질 끌고 갔다.

코앞까지 들이닥친 죽음의 존재에 수적들이 비명을 내질렀지만, 이미 사지가 결박당한 그들은 풍덩 소리와 함께 수면 아래로 가라앉았다.

오십여 명이 넘는 수적들이 차례차례 산 채로 수장(水葬)당하는 광경에 청풍이 창백한 얼굴로 입술을 깨물었다.

‘그럴 만도 하지.’

피도 무서워하는 놈이 이런 걸 견딜 수 있을 리가 없다.

나는 괜히 신경이 쓰여서 넌지시 말을 건넸다.

“눈 감고 있어. 끝나면 알려 줄게.”

“아니에요, 은인. 전 괜찮아요.”

“죽어도 싼 놈들이지만 그래도 사람이 죽는 모습이야. 보기 힘들 수도 있지.”

“아뇨.”

“응?”

청풍이 눈가를 움찔거리며 입을 열었다.

“저는 그저…… 익숙해지려고 노력 중이에요.”

익숙해지다니. 청풍이 이런 말을 할 줄이야.

청풍은 타고난 품성 자체가 선하고 또래의 청년들과 달리 속세에 찌들지 않았다.

그래서인지 피를 무서워하고 살생을 피해 왔는데, 지금 녀석에게서는 단단한 심지가 느껴졌다.

‘숭산에서 있었던 혈주(血主)와의 싸움. 그때부터인가?’

난생처음 겪은 죽음에 대한 두려움과 공포가 청풍의 뭔가를 깨운 것이 분명했다.

한편으로는 대견하기도 하고, 한편으로는 씁쓸하기도 했다.

‘어쩔 수 없지. 무림이니까.’

맞다. 이곳은 무림이다. 그것도 전운(戰運)이 감도는 무림.

이런 곳에서 언제까지 천진난만한 산골 청년으로 남아 있을 수는 없는 법이다.

‘이렇게라도 성장했다면…… 차라리 다행이지.’

금방이라도 감기려는 눈에 힘을 잔뜩 준 채로 버티던 청풍이 안도의 한숨을 내쉬었다. 마침내 수적들의 처리가 끝난 것이다.

그러나 아직 모든 것이 마무리된 것은 아니었다.

“황태구. 이제 네놈 차례다.”

무송의 낮은 목소리가 갑판 위에 울려 퍼졌다.

다른 수적들과는 달리 쇠사슬에 꽁꽁 묶인 채 무송의 앞에 무릎 꿇려진 오십 대의 사내. 황태구가 바로 이번 일을 주도한 흉수였다.

그 모습을 본 궁기방이 중얼거렸다.

“왜 여기에 무송이 있나 의아했는데, 이렇게 된 거로군.”

“무슨 소리야?”

“구파일방과 오대세가에도 파벌이 있는데, 수적 집단인 장강수로맹은 오죽할까.”

“저 황태구라는 놈이 파벌 싸움에서 밀렸다?”

“욕심 많고 난폭하기로 유명한 자였지. 몇 년 전만 해도 사천의 장강을 주름잡았는데…… 무송에게 밀려난 게 틀림없어.”

내부 알력 싸움에서 밀린 패배자가 막 나가다가 덜미를 붙잡혔다는 건가?

그런 생각을 하고 있을 때 황태구의 입이 열렸다.

“세상 물정 모르는 어린놈에게 할 말 따위 없다. 죽여라.”

“굳이 말하지 않아도 네놈의 소원처럼 될 것이다. 하지만 대체 왜 이런 일을 벌인 거지?”

“크큭, 멍청한 질문이로군. 나는 수적이다. 수적이 죽이고 빼앗는 것이 무엇이 문제가 된단 말이냐?”

“말이 안 통하는군. 진즉 네놈을 죽였어야 했어.”

얼굴을 굳힌 무송이 작살을 들어올린 그 순간이었다.

“선화아(船火兒) 무송 대협께서는 잠시 기다려 주시겠습니까.”

갑자기 들려온 누군가의 목소리가 사람들의 귓가를 파고들었다.

# Chapter 332

“Who dares cause trouble on the Yangtze!”

I didn’t expect anyone over there to answer.

Ignoring Mu Song’s shout with one ear, I circulated my internal energy and sharpened my eyesight.

The distance was easily over two hundred zhang. But my vision had improved enough that you could call me a human eagle, allowing me to take in the entire scene at a glance.

*That’s…*

River bandits.

Two ships far larger than the fast ship we were riding had surrounded a tiny boat, while black dots resembling arrows and harpoons flew at it without pause.

When I spotted the flags fluttering from the bandits’ ships, my gaze naturally shifted toward Mu Song.

“I don’t know what kind of scum they are, but they picked the wrong target. You there! Immediately deal with those rootless bastards… What’s wrong?”

“Senior, how should I put this?”

“What is it?”

“Those rootless bastards. They seem to belong to the Yangtze River Channel League.”

“……?”

“……?”

After a brief silence, Mu Song shouted,

“That’s impossible!”

“It’s not impossible. The flag says ‘Yangtze River Channel League’ in very bold lettering.”

“Didn’t you say you were illiterate a moment ago?”

Was he a river bandit or a razor blade? He had a surprisingly sharp side.

Instead of panicking, I hardened my expression and said,

“I’m a fast learner. Besides, is that the important thing right now? We need to punish those lawless thugs disrupting order on the Yangtze as quickly as possible!”

Mu Song looked like he wanted to punish me first, but he wholeheartedly agreed with my opinion.

“That’s right. In this day and age, how dare they commit murder on the Yangtze… I’ll kill those bastards with one blow!”

It was lamentable that those words had come from the mouth of a river bandit chief, but according to something Gung Gibang had casually told me, Mu Song belonged to the moderate faction within the Yangtze River Channel League.

His principle was that taking money was enough. There was no reason to take lives, too.

“……”

No, he was still taking the money.

Come to think of it, there wasn’t much difference between them after all. Still, in a Murim where people reached for their swords whenever they got bored, he really was more conscientious than most top-tier river bandits—especially one who was a Disciple of the Alliance Leader of the Yangtze River Channel League.

“Raise the red flag!”

At the booming command of their leader, Mu Song, five fast ships raised red flags signifying battle and charged forward at tremendous speed.

Whoooooosh!

The sails swelled taut in the wind that happened to blow at just the right moment. Modified to achieve maximum speed, the fast ships cut through the waves without hesitation, rapidly closing the distance.

When the two-hundred-zhang gap shrank by half in an instant, an urgent shout rang out among the river bandits preparing to attempt a boarding attack.

“F-fast ships!”

“Mu Song of Water Dragon Stronghold has appeared! Everyone, retreat!”

But Mu Song was not the sort of man to let them retreat in peace.

The distance between us and the enemy was already barely fifty zhang. As he glared at the bandits hurriedly returning to their ships, a sharp light flashed in his eyes.

“Let’s at least see what you bastards look like!”

With a teeth-grinding sound, Mu Song seized a massive harpoon, kicked off from the stern, and leaped into the air.

Boom!

The sturdy wooden deck splintered. At the same time, Mu Song’s body shot out in an arc and was roughly swallowed by the Yangtze.

*Isn’t that dangerous?*

It would be a mistake to think of the Yangtze as some valley stream in Gangwon Province.

Although this was a branch of the Yangtze that split away from the main channel, it was as wide and deep as the sea, and the current was viciously rough.

That was why even Hyuk Mujin, who had been dry-heaving, asked with a pale face,

“Shouldn’t we rescue him—ueeegh!”

“Gibang, pat that guy on the back.”

“I’m no nanny…”

Even Gung Gibang wasn’t a nanny. Who would hire a beggar as one?

Despite grumbling, Gung Gibang pounded Hyuk Mujin’s back and said,

“There’s a limit to ignorance. Do you think a river bandit chief would jump into the Yangtze without learning water-based martial arts? Especially a Disciple of the Seafaring King, who no one can match in the water?”

“Ah, right.”

“I don’t know who they are, but they picked the worst possible target. There’ll be funerals one after another today. Tsk, tsk.”

Gung Gibang’s prediction was accurate.

A few seconds later, Mu Song emerged from the water more than ten zhang ahead of the fast ship.

Spla-aaash!

Every time his massive body traced a supple curve like a wave, he surged forward like a water skier. My mouth fell open on its own.

“This can’t be happening!”

He was even faster than the fast ship.

Watching Mu Song charge toward the enemy vessel with the appearance of a fish-man, I felt my own blood begin to boil.

“Since it’s come to this, I’m going, too!”

Gung Gibang screamed,

“Going where?”

“Uweeegh!”

“Benefactor, me too!”

“Get lost, all of you! The Grand Line is calling me! The Yangtze is calling me!”

Shaking off the Bermuda Triangle, I raced across the deck and launched myself from the bow with all my strength.

Boom! Crack!

The bow shattered under the force. My body was swept up in weightlessness as wind slammed fiercely into my face.

Whoooooosh!

“Freedom! Freedom!”

I became a bird, then quickly lost momentum and began to fall.

“Senior!”

“Gasp!”

Tap!

I landed lightly on the back of a fish-man who happened to be passing by.

The angle and speed, the distance, the point where I would fall—all of it had been calculated perfectly. That was the only reason the result had been possible.

“Whew. Per-fect.”

“What part of that was perfect!”

Mu Song shouted at the unexpected free rider, but there was nothing he could do about it now that I was already aboard.

I glared at the river bandits hurriedly turning their ship around and shouted,

“Let’s go!”

“Damn it! Since it’s come to this, we’ll charge straight into the ship!”

“Yes, that’s my Senior!”

“We’ll settle this after it’s over!”

Spla-aaash!

Gritting his teeth, Mu Song increased his speed even further.

The river bandits had only just found their footing and were desperately trying to escape, but it was already too late.

We had become a single harpoon, shooting toward the side of their ship.

“Go, Senior! Fish-Man Jujutsu: Current—One-Arm Shoulder Throw!”

“Yaaaargh!”

Mu Song and I shouted at the top of our lungs as we thrust out our arms at the same time.

He held a harpoon, and I held a spear, but we had one thing in common.

Powerful qi gathered at the tips of both weapons.

Whoooooosh!

The two currents of Spear Energy cut through the wind and pierced the damp, sturdy side of the ship.

The next moment—

Kwaaang! Rumble-rumble-rumble!

A tremendous shock wave erupted along with a thunderous roar.

* * *

“Mujin.”

At my solemn voice, Hyuk Mujin finally stopped retching and answered with a pale face.

“Yes?”

“I think I may have the constitution of a river bandit.”

“What kind of nonsense is that?”

“Do you want to hear the wails?”

“I made a verbal mistake because I’m not feeling well. Thinking about it again, you do seem suited to it.”

“Right?”

“Yes. I can still vividly see the way you recklessly—no, courageously—pierced straight through the ship.”

“It was exhilarating.”

I nodded smugly and gazed at the ship that was slowly sinking.

On one side, Mu Song’s men were using the small skiffs carried aboard the fast ships to pull river bandits from the water, where they thrashed helplessly.

On the other ship, the river bandits had their heads hanging low and were being transferred to the fast ships one after another, bound together with ropes.

*One ship sunk. The other captured.*

That was an excellent result for my first naval battle.

Originally, I had planned to sink both ships. But the river bandits lost their will to fight as soon as they saw the ship carrying their comrades sink, and they surrendered.

Of course, even after surrendering, their ending was not particularly good.

“How dare scum like you tarnish the name of the Yangtze River Channel League?”

No matter how moderate Mu Song was, he was still a martial artist who had no qualms about killing and a river bandit who had lived his entire life on the harsh Yangtze.

Once Mu Song lost his temper, nothing could hold him back.

“Throw them to the fish.”

The tightly bound river bandits opened their eyes wide.

“T-this can’t be happening!”

“Stronghold Lord! Please, anything but that!”

But the only answer they received was Mu Song’s cold gaze.

“Stronghold Lord? The strongholds you belong to are different from mine. Why would I be your Stronghold Lord? And don’t worry. Your chief will be joining you soon, so you won’t be lonely.”

“We were wrong! Please, just this once…!”

“If you invaded Water Dragon Stronghold’s territory to carry out this kind of act, you should have been prepared for this much. Do you know why I had my men pull you from the water? So I could punish you with my own hands.”

At a jerk of Mu Song’s chin, his subordinates approached and dragged the river bandits away.

As the presence of death drew close enough to touch, the river bandits screamed. But their limbs had already been bound, and they sank beneath the surface with a series of splashes.

Cheongpung bit his lip with a pale face as he watched more than fifty river bandits being drowned alive one after another.

*It makes sense.*

Someone who was afraid even of blood had no chance of enduring a sight like this.

Concerned despite myself, I spoke to him quietly.

“Close your eyes. I’ll tell you when it’s over.”

“No, Benefactor. I’m fine.”

“They may deserve to die, but you’re still watching people die. It might be hard to see.”

“No.”

“Hm?”

Cheongpung’s eyes twitched as he opened his mouth.

“I’m just… trying to get used to it.”

Get used to it? I had never expected Cheongpung to say something like that.

Cheongpung was naturally kind-hearted, and unlike other young men his age, he had not been tainted by the ways of the world.

Perhaps that was why he had been afraid of blood and avoided killing. But now, I could feel a firm resolve within him.

*Was it the battle with the Blood Lord at Mount Song? Did it begin then?*

The fear and terror of death he had experienced for the first time must have awakened something inside Cheongpung.

I was proud of him in one way, but bitter in another.

*It can’t be helped. This is the Murim.*

That was right. This was the Murim—a Murim where the winds of war were gathering.

He could not remain an innocent mountain youth forever in a place like this.

*If he managed to grow even this way… maybe it was for the best.*

Cheongpung stubbornly forced strength into his eyes, which were about to close, and let out a sigh of relief. The river bandits had finally been dealt with.

But everything was not over yet.

“Hwang Tae-gu. It’s your turn now.”

Mu Song’s low voice rang out across the deck.

Unlike the other river bandits, a man in his fifties had been forced to his knees before Mu Song, tightly bound in chains.

Hwang Tae-gu was the mastermind behind this incident.

Gung Gibang muttered as he watched him.

“I was wondering why Mu Song was here. So that’s how things turned out.”

“What do you mean?”

“The Nine Sects and One Gang and the Five Great Families have their factions. How much more so would a group of river bandits like the Yangtze River Channel League?”

“That Hwang Tae-gu lost a factional struggle?”

“He was famous for being greedy and violent. Just a few years ago, he lorded over the Yangtze in Sichuan… There’s no doubt Mu Song pushed him out.”

So a loser in an internal power struggle had gone rogue and finally been caught?

I was thinking that when Hwang Tae-gu opened his mouth.

“I have nothing to say to a young brat who knows nothing about the ways of the world. Kill me.”

“You won’t need to say anything for your wish to come true. But why did you do something like this?”

“Heh heh. What a stupid question. I’m a river bandit. What’s wrong with a river bandit killing and taking whatever he wants?”

“There’s no reasoning with you. I should have killed you sooner.”

That was the moment Mu Song hardened his expression and raised his harpoon.

“Great Hero Mu Song, the Ship-Fire Boy, would you wait a moment?”

A voice suddenly rang out, piercing the ears of everyone present.
