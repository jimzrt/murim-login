# Durable State Update — Chapter 327

Return exactly one JSON object and no Markdown fence. Record only facts established
by this chapter. Do not use tools, edit prose, infer future events, or copy archived
profile continuity. Profile updates are maintenance, not chapter recaps: replace
existing fields to remove resolved events, stale travel/combat narration, and
duplicated facts. Preserve only stable identity, role, personality, voice,
relationships, and currently active unresolved/status facts. If a previous
detail no longer helps translate a future chapter, delete it. Never add a fact
merely because it appeared in the reading copy.

`context` must contain exactly the durable context schema shown below, with version
1 and safe_through 327. Keep at most
2 continuity_sources. Keep
`active_continuity` to at most 12 concise items,
`open_questions` to at most 5 items, and
`temporary_decisions` to at most 5 items.
Keep the serialized context under 16384 UTF-8 bytes.
Use only chapter numbers through 327. Profile updates may replace only one
complete line in Aliases, Role, Personality, Voice, or Relationships. Do not
return Safe through updates; the controller sets that field automatically.
Each profile field should be one concise sentence; never append semicolon-separated
chapter history.
`names` contains only newly required Korean-to-English rows; Korean keys must occur
in the source. `address_pairs` contains only newly required speaker→addressee rows;
each Korean key must occur in the source or already appear in the address ledger,
and at least one endpoint must occur in the source (first-person narrators may be
ledger-only). Speaker and addressee must be Hangul source spellings (Arabic digits
allowed in titles such as 1팀장; do not romanize). Do not invent risk-register rows. Beat
plot paragraphs are plain strings; continuity and translation decisions are concise
list items.
Return this exact shape:

“가장 중요한 얘기가 남았군요. 안 그런가요?”

검을 늘어트린 주화란은 아름다웠고, 한편으로는 차가웠다.

서릿발 같은 기세가 그녀를 중심으로 솟아올라 한 사람을 향했다.

“송 표두.”

주화란의 시선을 따라 사람들의 고개가 돌아간다. 그 끝에 그가 있었다.

삼십 대 초반으로 짐작되는 사내. 나름 잘생긴 용모였지만 사납게 위로 솟구친 눈썹이 흠이다.

송일섬의 입술이 비틀림과 동시에 냉랭한 목소리가 흘러나왔다.

“지금 날 부른 거요?”

아직 다루 안에 남아 있던 사람들의 반응은 딱 두 가지였다.

송일섬이 누군지 몰라 어리둥절한 외부인들, 그리고 얼굴을 딱딱하게 굳힌 용봉표국의 표사들.

가장 먼저 앞으로 나선 총표두 허준의 얼굴에는 은은한 노기가 묻어 나왔다.

“소국주님 앞이다. 예를 갖추지 못할까.”

“예의라면 충분히 지켰소. 하지만 당신들은 십 년째 같은 말을 하는군.”

“이놈이 감히……!”

“그럼 감히 묻겠는데, 내게 이런 말을 하는 총표두는 왜 사람들 앞에서 소국주의 이름을 부르는 거요?”

“그, 그건.”

“굳이 대답할 필요는 없소. 총표두가 소국주를 어찌 부르건 상관없으니까. 다만 내게 예의를 강요하진 마시오.”

말투와 언행이 띠꺼워서 그렇지, 송일섬의 말이 틀리진 않은 모양이다.

순간 말문이 막힌 허준을 바라보는 내게 월화가 속삭였다.

“진 공자, 저 사람 잘 알아요?”

“누구요, 허준? 아니면…….”

“당연히 젊고 잘생긴 쪽이지. 용봉표국의 총표두야 이미 알고 있고.”

“……그런데 왜 저한테 물어봐요? 다른 사람도 아니고 하오문 섬서 지부장씩이나 되시는 분이.”

“나를 높게 평가해 주는 건 좋은데, 부임한 지 반년도 안 된 지부장이 뭘 얼마나 알겠어? 알려진 명문 대파의 제자라면 모를까, 일개 표사까지 알기에는 나도 벅차요.”

“일개 표사라……. 저자가 누구인지는 압니까?”

“음. 용봉삼표(龍鳳三鏢)에 젊고 성격 나쁜 표사 한 명이 있다는 것 정도?”

송일섬. 직책은 표두. 저자에 대해 내가 아는 것도 딱 그 정도다.

하지만 나는 월화가 모르는 한 가지를 더 알고 있었다. 바로 송일섬의 실력이다.

‘상당한 고수다. 십봉룡 이상이야.’

무림과 현대를 오가며 매번 깨닫게 되는 사실이 있다면, 레벨이 절대적인 수치가 아니라는 것이다.

레벨이 높아도 허당인 놈들이 있고, 그보다 낮아도 더욱 강한 놈이 있다.

그런 면에서 송일섬은 진짜배기였다. 걸음걸이와 손의 미세한 움직임만 봐도 알 수 있었다. 그가 수많은 실전 경험과 뛰어난 무공을 지닌 검객이라는 것을.

‘저 나이에 저 정도 실력자가 얼마나 있지?’

아무리 명문 대파의 제자가 아니라지만 저 정도 실력이라면 무림에서는 진작 이름이 알려졌어야 했다.

낭중지추(囊中之錐)라는 말이 심심해서 나온 말이 아니니까.

‘그런데 아무도 송곳의 존재를 몰랐단 말이지. 그것도 자그마치 십 년 동안이나.’

결국 답은 하나다.

송곳은 의도적으로 자신을 숨겼다. 제법 오랜 시간을 함께한 용봉표국의 사람들조차 그의 실력을 모를 정도로.

‘이것 봐라…….’

문득 어떤 생각이 뇌리를 스쳤다. 지금으로서는 확신할 수 없지만, 주의 깊게 지켜봐야 할 놈인 건 분명하다.

‘마음 같아서는 지금 당장이라도 나서고 싶지만.’

이건 주화란이 직접 풀어야 하는 매듭이다.

내가 언제든지 출수(出手)할 수 있도록 만반의 준비를 끝마치는 사이, 잠시 주춤했던 허준은 거세게 송일섬을 몰아붙였다.

“송 표두. 아니, 송일섬! 허튼소리는 집어치우고 어서 이실직고하지 못할까!”

“무슨 말을 하는지 모르겠소만.”

“이리 발뺌하니 단도직입적으로 묻지. 천년설삼을 어디에 감추었느냐?”

“모르는 일이오.”

“아직 늦지 않았다. 지금이라도 네 죄를 인정하고 천년설삼의 행방을 털어놓는다면…….”

“모른다 하였소.”

송일섬의 대답에 허준이 착 가라앉은 눈빛으로 그를 응시했다.

“정녕 이렇게 나올 생각이냐?”

“그 말, 그대로 돌려주지.”

“지난 정을 생각해서 마지막 기회를 주었건만…… 어쩔 수 없군.”

허준이 손을 들어 올림과 동시에 이십여 명의 표사들이 앞뒤를 넓게 포위하며 퇴로(退路)를 막았다.

용봉삼표의 남은 두 사람으로 짐작되는 중년 표두들은 허준과 함께 삼각 대형으로 송일섬을 둘러쌌다.

활시위처럼 팽팽한 분위기 속, 침묵을 지키던 주화란이 불쑥 입을 연 것은 바로 그때였다.

“모두 물러서세요.”

“화란아. 순순히 죄를 인정할 놈이 아니다. 우선 제압한 후에…….”

“기다리세요, 허 숙부. 물어볼 것이 있어요.”

쉬리릭!

회전하는 손목, 뱀처럼 휘어진 연검의 검면이 탁자에 쌓인 죽간 중 하나를 쳐 내어 송일섬에게 날려 보냈다.

“이게 무엇이오?”

“흥미로운 기록들이 많더군요.”

죽간에 적힌 내용을 확인한 송일섬이 중얼거렸다.

“이건…….”

“맞아요. 지난 이 년간 송 표두가 책임졌던 표행에 대한 기록입니다.”

“실패한 것들만 모아 놨구려.”

“왜 하오문과 개방이 이런 정보들을 수집했을까요?”

“종남파와 연관이 되어 있다고 생각했겠지.”

“송 표두가 이 년간 맡았던 표행의 횟수는 열다섯 번. 그중 열 번을 실패했고 그때마다 우리 용봉표국은 상당한 위약금을 물어내야 했죠.”

열다섯 번 중에 열 번을 실패하다니. 성공 확률이 절반도 되지 않는다.

저 정도면 개방이나 하오문이 아니라 송일섬의 부모님도 자식을 의심할 거다.

주화란은 담담한 목소리로 말을 이어 갔다.

“그뿐만이 아닙니다. 송 표두가 부장으로 참여한 표행들을 보면 석연치 않은 점들이 참 많더군요.”

“매번 최선을 다했지만 실패했지. 내가 소국주께 드릴 수 있는 대답은 그것밖에 없소.”

“그것으론 부족합니다.”

후웅, 투두둑.

다시 한번 연검이 휘둘러졌고, 검풍(劍風)에 휩쓸린 이십여 개의 죽간은 허공을 가르며 송일섬의 발치 아래 떨어졌다.

“이것들도 전부 나와 연관된 기록이오? 많기도 하군.”

혀를 찬 그가 검을 옆에 기대어 놓고 죽간을 들어 읽기 시작했다.

“저, 저놈이…….”

총표두 허준은 당장이라도 배신자를 향해 달려들고 싶은 마음이 굴뚝같아 보였지만, 주화란의 눈짓에 검을 늘어트려야 했다.

기다림은 그리 길지 않았다.

“그래, 그렇군.”

중얼거림과 함께 마지막 죽간을 내려놓은 송일섬이 사나워 보이는 눈썹을 치켜떴다.

“어떻게 알았지?”

“교묘하더군요. 실수로 눈감고 넘어가 줄 수 있을 만큼.”

“이것만으로도 파악하다니, 생각했던 것 이상으로 명석하군. 그저 어린애라고만 생각했는데…… 내 너를 과소평가했다.”

“참으로 애석하네요.”

“뭐가 말이냐?”

“비록 피 한 방울 섞이지 않았지만, 가족이라 생각했으니까.”

“가족이라. 유약한 소리다. 세월은 강산(江山)도 바꾸는데, 사람은 오죽할까.”

어느새 송일섬의 말투는 하오체에서 완전한 하대로 바뀌어 있었다. 하지만 왠지 모르게 그 모든 것들이 흐르는 물처럼 자연스러웠다.

송일섬은 갑갑했던 옷을 벗은 사람처럼 홀가분하게 물었다.

“자, 그래서 이제 어쩔 셈이지?”

“죄인을 벌해야지요.”

“자식은 부모를 닮는 법. 군자검의 핏줄인 네가 할 수 있을까.”

주화란이 차갑게 대답했다.

“해야 하는 일이고, 해낼 겁니다.”

츠츠츠츠!

공력이 실린 연검이 빳빳하게 솟구친다. 투명한 검신에 주화란의 굳은 얼굴이 비쳤다.

그녀의 입술 사이로 나직한 목소리가 흘러나왔다.

“상대가 그 누구라 할지라도.”

쐐애애액!

아무런 예고도 없이 움직인 그녀는 용봉표국의 누구보다 빨랐다.

아직 초입에 불과하나 주화란 역시 한 사람의 절정 고수. 검공과 신법에는 쾌(快)의 묘리가 스며들어 있었다.

푸푹!

허공을 가르며 빛살처럼 쏘아진 연검이 목표를 정확히 꿰뚫었다.

피육을 꿰뚫는 소리와 함께 솟구치는 핏줄기. 그리고 한 사람의 입에서 터져 나온 비명.

“크아아악!”

피를 흩뿌리며 무릎 꿇는 사내를 바라보는 주화란의 눈꺼풀이 파르르 떨렸다.

이어지는 목소리는 한 사람을 향한 물음이다. 단 한 번도 의심해 본 적 없었던 그를 향한 질타다.

“왜 그런 선택을 하신 겁니까, 허 숙부.”

“화, 화란아.”

사내가 고개를 들었다. 새하얗게 질린 총표두 허준의 얼굴이 그곳에 있었다.



* * *



쐐애애액!

머리털이 쭈뼛서고 등골이 오싹했다. 그러나 희미한 파공성을 인식했을 때에는 모든 것이 늦은 후였다.

푸욱!

피육을 파고드는 날붙이는 얼음처럼 차가웠고, 뒤이어 찾아온 고통은 불에 덴 듯 뜨거웠다.

총표두 허준은 비명과 함께 무릎을 꿇었다.

그 와중에도 하얗게 물든 머릿속에서는 한 가지 생각만이 빙글빙글 돌고 있었다.

‘일이 어긋났다.’

비록 진태경이라는 불청객의 등장으로 말미암아 판도가 뒤바뀌었지만, 그에게도 나쁠 것 없는 일이었다.

지난 이 년간 조금씩, 때로는 대범하게 실수를 가장하여 은밀히 빼돌린 재물이 은자 수천 냥에 달한다.

이미 막대한 재산을 손에 넣은 뒤고, 이번 일로 용봉표국이 부흥한다면 총표두인 그의 권세는 더욱 높아질 것이다.

거기에 믿는 이들을 배신했다는 양심의 가책도 피할 수 있으니 일석이조였다.

그런데…….

‘왜 하필 지금!’

송일섬의 목을 베면 모두 끝나는 일이었다.

놈은 용봉표국을 배신하고 종남파과 내통한 배반자로 죽었을 것이고, 이번 일은 더 이상의 잡음 없이 조용히 마무리될 수 있었다.

‘만약을 대비해 종남파에조차 내 정체를 철저히 숨겼거늘. 어찌 알아차렸단 말인가.’

고통. 그리고 고통보다 큰 충격으로 굳어 버린 허준의 귓가로 나직한 목소리가 파고들었다.

“왜 그런 선택을 하신 겁니까, 허 숙부.”

고개 숙인 허준의 몸이 부르르 떨렸다.

그는 저 목소리의 주인을 안다. 모를 수가 없었다. 다른 누구도 아닌, 갓난아기 시절부터 지켜봐 왔던 아이가 아닌가.

그녀는 의형의 장중보옥(掌中寶玉)이었고, 한때 허준이 친자식보다 더 자식처럼 생각했던 하나뿐인 질녀(姪女)였다.

그리고…… 그의 어깨에 검을 찔러 넣은 장본인이기도 했다.

“화, 화란아.”

허준은 천천히 고개를 들어 자신을 내려다보는 주화란과 시선을 맞추었다.

침착했던 목소리와는 달리 격동으로 떨리는 그녀의 눈동자를 보자 잠시 잊고 있던 감정이 고개를 쳐들었다.

그건 희망이었다.

‘살 수 있다.’

주화란의 흔들리는 감정을, 허준은 즉각 알아차렸다.

지금 그녀는 정과 배신감 사이에서 갈등하고 있었다. 그것이 허준에게 남은 유일한 활로(活路)였다.

“내가 잘못했다. 전부 내 잘못이다!”

“숙부.”

“살려다오. 내 이렇게 부탁하마!”

허준은 다급하게 외쳤다. 믿었던 상관의 배반에 아연한 표사들과 다른 이들의 시선 따위는 신경 쓰지 않았다.

자신의 체면? 타인들의 멸시? 죽은 자는 그조차 느낄 수 없다.

그는 이 자리에서 살아남아 내일의 태양을 볼 수 있다면 뭐든 할 수 있었다.

“큭. 화란아…….”

허준이 고통으로 신음했다. 그의 오른쪽 어깨를 정확히 관통한 연검. 그 검자루를 쥔 주화란의 손이 잘게 떨리고 있었다.

“차라리 변명을 해 보세요. 왜 그랬는지. 왜 이럴 수밖에 없었는지.”

그렇게 하여 살아남을 가능성이 조금이라도 늘어난다면, 허준은 진작 온갖 변명을 늘어놓았을 것이다.

하지만 그는 주화란의 성격을 잘 알고 있었다. 검을 휘둘렀다는 것은 이미 확신이 섰다는 뜻. 이런 상황에서 어설픈 변명은 도리어 명을 재촉할 뿐이다.

무조건 읍소(泣訴)하며 은근히 접근해야 했다.

“모두 이 모자란 숙부의 불찰이다. 그것밖에 할 말이 없구나.”

허준은 고개를 축 늘어트리고 눈시울을 붉혔다. 효과는 확실했다. 그는 검에 실려 있던 힘이 약해지는 것을 느끼며 말을 이었다.

“부끄럽지만 뇌물을 받은 적이 있었다. 한데 형님이 급작스럽게 쓰러지신 후, 그것을 빌미로 종남파가 접근해 왔고 나는…… 나는 내쳐질까 두려웠다. 평생을 바친 표국을 떠나기 싫었고 너를 다치지 않게 하겠다는 종남파의 약속을 믿었어.”

“…….”

“한 번, 단 한 번만 응하기로 마음먹었지만, 이미 빠져나올 수 없는 수렁에 발을 디딘 후였다.”

“그게 전부 사실인가요?”

“내가 어찌 거짓을 고하겠느냐.”

말과는 달리 허준의 말에서 진실은 하나밖에 없었다.

바로 뇌물을 받았다는 것.

군자검이 쓰러진 직후 자신의 정체를 숨기고 종남파에 접근한 것도 그였고, 이 은밀한 관계는 이 년 동안 계속되었다.

‘이 순간만 모면하면 된다. 이 순간만!’

눈물이 주르륵 흘러내렸다. 반성이 아닌, 죽음에 대한 공포와 살기 위한 염원이 담긴 눈물이었다.

“부디 용서해다오……!”

그 간절한 외침에 지켜보던 사람들이 고개를 절레절레 내저었다. 차마 그 모습을 볼 수 없어 고개를 돌리는 표사들도 부지기수였다.

하지만 주화란은 달랐다. 그녀는 입술을 깨문 채 허준을 바라보다가 불쑥 입을 열었다.

“천년설삼은 어떻게 가로챈 거죠? 분명 제가 한시도 떼어 놓지 않았는데.”

“그, 그건…….”

“사실대로 고하세요.”

“……음식에 몽혼제(朦昏劑)를 섞었다. 다들 지쳐 있던 터라 소량으로도 충분했지.”

몽혼제는 정신을 흐리고 수면에 빠져들게 하는 일종의 마약이었고, 효과는 확실했다.

절정 고수인 주화란조차 지금까지의 여독이라 생각하고 곤잠에 빠져들었으니까.

“그래서 그날, 제 방문 앞에 계셨던 거로군요.”

“나가면서도 기척을 내지 않도록 주의해야 했다. 저놈, 아니 송 표두가 몽혼제를 먹고도 날이 밝을 때까지 깨어 있었으니까.”

팔짱을 낀 채 벽면에 기대어 있던 송일섬이 무뚝뚝한 얼굴로 중얼거렸다.

“그게 몽혼제였군. 어쩐지 그날따라 피곤하더라니. 다음에는 좀 더 좋은 걸 써 보시오. 당신에게 다음이 있을지는 모르겠지만.”

저런 쳐 죽일 놈을 보았나.

허준은 튀어나오려는 욕설을 간신히 억누르며 주화란을 바라보았다.

“황보엄, 그 늙은이가 나를 협박했다. 천년설삼을 바꿔치기하지 않으면 나와 가족을 죽이고 용봉표국을 멸문시키겠다고 했어. 난 모두를 지키고 싶었을 뿐이다!”

“그렇다면 잘못된 판단을 하셨군요.”

“네 말이 맞다. 병상에 계신 형님을 찾아가 울며 사실을 고한 적도 있었지. 하지만, 하지만 실수를 되돌릴 수 없었다.”

“실수?”

아버지의 이야기에 주화란의 눈빛이 떨린 것은 잠시뿐.

이내 그녀가 작게 고개를 저었다.

“틀렸어요. 그건 실수가 아니라 선택이었어요. 숙부.”

“화란아……!”

“아버지께서는 종종 제게 말씀하셨었죠. 모든 선택에는 책임이 따른다고. 비록 물려받은 가업(家業)을 번성시키는 것에는 실패했지만, 당신의 선택을 단 한 번도 후회하신 적이 없다고.”

허준은 문득 깨달았다. 주화란의 눈에서 보이던 갈등과 흔들림이 서서히 사라지고 있음을.

‘설마?’

아니다. 그럴 리 없다. 이럴 수는 없다!

허준의 뺨을 타고 눈물과 식은땀이 줄줄 흘러내렸다.

그는 필사적으로 목소리를 높였다.

“한 번만, 마지막으로 한 번만 기회를 다오! 나는 네 아버지의 하나뿐인 의제이며 네 숙부가 아니냐. 화란아, 그간의 정을 봐서라도 제발!”

“정, 이라고 하셨나요.”

“그래, 삼십 년을 형님과 고락(苦樂)을 함께한 나다. 네 아버지라면, 그분이라면 이토록 쉽게 내 목숨을 거두진 않을 것이다!”

“허 숙부. 아니, 총표두 허준.”

바닥에 쿵쿵 머리를 찧던 허준이 멍하니 고개를 들었다.

지금껏 볼 수 없었던 질녀의 눈이 그곳에 있었다. 그 어떤 망설임도 남아 있지 않은 차가운 눈동자였다.

“당신의 말이 맞아. 내 아버지였다면 당신을 용서했겠지. 하지만…….”

얼어붙은 허준을 향해 나직한 목소리가 이어졌다.

“난 군자검(君子劍) 주호군이 아니라, 은비화(隱匕花) 주화란이다.”

그리고 다음 순간, 은빛 검광(劍光)이 허준의 눈앞을 가득 메웠다.

쉭, 서걱!

# Chapter 327

“We still have the most important matter left to discuss. Don’t you agree?”

Ju Hwaran was beautiful with her sword hanging loosely at her side. She was also cold.

An aura as sharp as frost rose around her and focused on one person.

“Captain Song.”

Following Ju Hwaran’s gaze, everyone turned their heads. He stood at the end of it.

He was a man who looked to be in his early thirties. His features were fairly handsome, but his fiercely arched eyebrows were a flaw.

As Song Ilseom’s lips twisted, a chilly voice slipped out.

“Are you calling me?”

The people still inside the pavilion fell into exactly two groups.

The outsiders, who were confused because they did not know who Song Ilseom was, and the escorts of the Yongbong Escort Bureau, whose faces had gone rigid.

Chief Escort Heo Jun was the first to step forward. A faint trace of anger showed on his face.

“You’re standing before the Young Bureau Head. Can’t you show proper respect?”

“I’ve shown enough respect. But you people have been saying the same thing for ten years.”

“How dare you…!”

“Then let me ask you something. Why is the Chief Escort who insists that I show proper respect calling the Young Bureau Head by her name in front of everyone?”

“Th-that’s…”

“You don’t need to answer. I don’t care what you call the Young Bureau Head. Just don’t demand that I show you respect.”

His tone and behavior were obnoxious, but Song Ilseom did not seem to be wrong.

As I stared at Heo Jun, who had been rendered speechless, Wolhwa whispered to me.

“Young Master Jin, do you know that man well?”

“Who? Heo Jun? Or…”

“The young and handsome one, obviously. I already know who Chief Escort Heo is.”

“Then why are you asking me? You’re the Shaanxi Branch Leader of the Lower District Sect, of all people.”

“It’s nice that you think so highly of me, but what could a Branch Leader who has been in her post for less than half a year possibly know? If he were a disciple of a famous major sect, maybe. But knowing every ordinary escort captain is beyond even me.”

“An ordinary escort captain… Do you know who he is?”

“Hmm. I know that one of the Dragon-Phoenix Three Escorts is a young escort captain with a nasty temper. That’s about it.”

Song Ilseom. His position was escort captain. That was about all I knew of him, too.

But I knew one thing Wolhwa did not.

Song Ilseom’s strength.

*He’s a considerable master. Stronger than the Ten Dragons and Phoenixes.*

If there was one thing I had learned from moving between the Murim and the modern world, it was that Level was not an absolute measure.

Some people were useless despite having high Levels, while others were much stronger than those above them despite having lower Levels.

Song Ilseom was the real thing. I could tell just by watching his stride and the minute movements of his hands. He was a swordsman with extensive real-combat experience and exceptional martial arts.

*How many people his age are that strong?*

Even if he was not a disciple of a famous major sect, someone of his ability should have become known throughout the Murim long ago.

A needle in a bag was bound to poke through eventually.

*Yet no one knew the needle was there. Not for ten whole years.*

There was only one possible answer.

The needle had deliberately hidden itself, so thoroughly that even the people of the Yongbong Escort Bureau who had spent years with him had no idea how strong he truly was.

*Well, well…*

A thought suddenly crossed my mind. I could not be certain yet, but he was clearly someone I needed to watch carefully.

*I’d like to step in right now.*

But this was a knot Ju Hwaran had to untangle herself.

While I finished making all the preparations necessary to act at any moment, Heo Jun—who had hesitated for a brief instant—began pressing Song Ilseom even more fiercely.

“Captain Song. No, Song Ilseom! Stop spouting nonsense and confess everything already!”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Fine. I’ll ask you directly. Where did you hide the Thousand-Year Snow Ginseng?”

“I know nothing about it.”

“It’s not too late. If you admit your crimes and tell us where the Thousand-Year Snow Ginseng is, even now…”

“I said I don’t know.”

At Song Ilseom’s answer, Heo Jun stared at him with eyes that had gone flat and cold.

“Are you really going to play it this way?”

“I could say the same to you.”

“I was giving you one last chance for old times’ sake… but I suppose it can’t be helped.”

As Heo Jun raised his hand, more than twenty escorts spread out around Song Ilseom, blocking his escape in every direction.

The two middle-aged escort captains presumed to be the other members of the Dragon-Phoenix Three Escorts surrounded Song Ilseom together with Heo Jun, forming a triangle.

The atmosphere was stretched taut as a bowstring.

That was when Ju Hwaran, who had remained silent until then, suddenly spoke.

“All of you, step back.”

“Hwaran, he’s not going to confess willingly. We should subdue him first and then—”

“Wait, Uncle Heo. I have something to ask him.”

Whoosh!

Her wrist turned, and the flat of her snake-curved flexible sword struck one of the bamboo slips piled on the table, sending it flying toward Song Ilseom.

“What is this?”

“There are quite a few interesting records here.”

After checking what was written on the bamboo slip, Song Ilseom muttered.

“This is…”

“That’s right. They’re records of the escort missions you were responsible for over the past two years.”

“You’ve gathered only the failures.”

“Why do you think the Lower District Sect and the Beggars’ Sect collected this information?”

“You must have thought they were connected to the Zhongnan Sect.”

“Captain Song was responsible for fifteen escort missions over the past two years. Ten of them failed, and each time, our Yongbong Escort Bureau had to pay a substantial contractual penalty.”

Ten failures out of fifteen. His success rate was less than half.

At that point, even his parents would have suspected him—not just the Beggars’ Sect or the Lower District Sect.

Ju Hwaran continued in a calm voice.

“That’s not all. Looking at the escort missions in which you participated as an assistant escort captain, there are many things that seem suspicious.”

“I did my best every time, but I failed. That is the only answer I can give the Young Bureau Head.”

“That isn’t enough.”

Whoosh! Clatter!

Once again, her flexible sword swung. More than twenty bamboo slips swept up in the sword wind, cut through the air, and fell at Song Ilseom’s feet.

“Are these all records connected to me? There certainly are a lot.”

He clicked his tongue, leaned his sword beside him, and began picking up the bamboo slips to read them.

“That bastard…”

Chief Escort Heo Jun looked ready to charge at the traitor then and there, but at a glance from Ju Hwaran, he had no choice but to let his sword droop.

The wait was not a long one.

“So that’s how it was.”

After muttering those words and setting down the final bamboo slip, Song Ilseom raised his fierce-looking eyebrows.

“How did you figure it out?”

“You did it cleverly. Cleverly enough that someone could close their eyes and dismiss it as a mistake.”

“You figured it out from this alone? You’re sharper than I expected. I thought you were merely a child, but… I underestimated you.”

“That’s a shame.”

“What is?”

“Though not a single drop of blood passes between us, I thought of you as family.”

“Family. What soft talk. Time changes even mountains and rivers, so how much more does it change people?”

At some point, Song Ilseom had gone from formal politeness to openly talking down to her. Yet somehow, every change had come as naturally as flowing water.

He asked in a carefree voice, like a man who had just taken off a constricting set of clothes.

“So what are you going to do now?”

“Punish the criminal.”

“Children resemble their parents. Can you really do it, as Junzi Sword’s bloodline?”

Ju Hwaran answered coldly.

“It is something I have to do, and I will do it.”

Hissssss!

Her flexible sword, charged with internal energy, rose stiffly into the air. Ju Hwaran’s hardened face was reflected in the transparent blade.

A low voice slipped between her lips.

“No matter who I am facing.”

Whoosh!

She moved without warning, faster than anyone else in the Yongbong Escort Bureau.

Though she had only just entered the Peak realm, Ju Hwaran was still a Peak master. The subtlety of speed was woven into both her sword arts and her movement technique.

Thrust!

The flexible sword shot forward like a ray of light and pierced its target exactly.

A wet sound rang out as it pierced flesh. Blood spurted into the air, followed by a scream from a single man.

“Gaaah!”

Ju Hwaran’s eyelids trembled as she watched the man kneel, spraying blood.

The voice that followed was a question aimed at one person.

A condemnation directed at the man she had never once doubted.

“Why did you make that choice, Uncle Heo?”

“H-Hwaran.”

The man raised his head.

The pale, bloodless face of Chief Escort Heo Jun was revealed.

* * *

Whoosh!

Heo Jun’s hair stood on end, and a chill ran down his spine. But by the time he registered the faint sound of something cutting through the air, it was already too late.

Thud!

The blade that pierced through flesh was cold as ice. The pain that followed was hot as fire.

Chief Escort Heo Jun dropped to his knees with a scream.

Even then, only one thought continued to circle through his bleached-white mind.

*Things have gone wrong.*

Although the situation had been overturned by the unexpected arrival of Jin Taekyung, it had not been a bad turn of events for him.

Over the past two years, he had secretly skimmed off wealth worth several thousand silver nyang, sometimes by pretending to make small mistakes and sometimes by making bolder ones.

He had already amassed a tremendous fortune. If the Yongbong Escort Bureau prospered because of this incident, his authority as Chief Escort would rise even higher.

On top of that, he could avoid the guilt of betraying the people he trusted.

It would have been the best of both worlds.

But then…

*Why now, of all times?!*

If he cut Song Ilseom’s throat, everything would be over.

The man would die as a traitor who had betrayed the Yongbong Escort Bureau and colluded with the Zhongnan Sect, and the matter could be quietly wrapped up without any further trouble.

*I even hid my identity so thoroughly from the Zhongnan Sect, just in case. How did they figure it out?*

Pain.

And then, a shock greater than the pain itself hardened Heo Jun in place.

A low voice pierced his ears.

“Why did you make that choice, Uncle Heo?”

Heo Jun’s bowed body trembled.

He knew the owner of that voice. He could not have failed to recognize it.

It belonged to the girl he had watched over since she was a baby.

She had been his sworn brother’s treasured jewel, the one and only niece he had once regarded as more his own child than his biological children.

And…

She was also the person who had driven a sword through his shoulder.

“H-Hwaran.”

Heo Jun slowly raised his head and met the eyes of Ju Hwaran looking down at him.

Her voice had been calm, but her eyes trembled with emotion. Seeing that, an emotion he had temporarily forgotten rose to the surface.

Hope.

*I can live.*

Heo Jun immediately recognized the turmoil in Ju Hwaran’s eyes.

She was caught between affection and betrayal. That was the only avenue of escape he had left.

“I was wrong. It was all my fault!”

“Uncle.”

“Please spare me. I’m begging you!”

Heo Jun cried out desperately. He did not care about the horrified looks of the escorts or anyone else watching their trusted superior betray them.

His dignity? The contempt of others?

The dead could not feel any of it.

He would do anything if it meant surviving this place and seeing tomorrow’s sun.

“Urgh. Hwaran…”

Heo Jun groaned in pain. Ju Hwaran’s flexible sword had pierced straight through his right shoulder, and the hand gripping the hilt was trembling slightly.

“Then make an excuse. Tell me why you did it. Tell me why you had no choice.”

If making excuses could have increased his chances of survival by even a little, Heo Jun would have already begun listing every excuse he could think of.

But he knew Ju Hwaran’s personality well. The fact that she had swung her sword meant she was already certain. A halfhearted excuse would only hasten his death.

He had to beg unconditionally and work his way into her heart.

“It was all the fault of this foolish uncle. I have nothing else to say.”

Heo Jun lowered his head and reddened his eyes.

The effect was immediate. He felt the strength in the sword weaken and continued speaking.

“It’s shameful, but I once accepted a bribe. Then, after Hyung suddenly collapsed, the Zhongnan Sect approached me using that as leverage, and I… I was afraid I would be cast out. I didn’t want to leave the Escort Bureau I had devoted my entire life to, and I believed the Zhongnan Sect’s promise that they wouldn’t hurt you.”

“…”

“I intended to agree only once—just once—but by then I had already stepped into a swamp I could never escape.”

“Is all of that true?”

“How could I lie to you?”

Contrary to his words, there was only one truth in Heo Jun’s entire speech.

He had accepted a bribe.

He had been the one who approached the Zhongnan Sect while concealing his identity immediately after Junzi Sword collapsed, and that secret relationship had continued for two years.

*I just have to get through this moment. Just this moment!*

Tears streamed down his face. They contained no remorse—only his fear of death and his desperate wish to survive.

“Please forgive me…!”

At his desperate plea, the people watching shook their heads from side to side. More than a few escorts turned away, unable to bear the sight.

But Ju Hwaran was different.

She stared at Heo Jun with her lips pressed tightly together before suddenly speaking.

“How did you steal the Thousand-Year Snow Ginseng? I never let it out of my sight, not even for a moment.”

“Th-that…”

“Tell me the truth.”

“…I mixed a mind-clouding drug into the food. Everyone was exhausted, so a small amount was enough.”

The drug was a narcotic that clouded the mind and induced sleep, and its effects were reliable.

Even Ju Hwaran, a Peak master, had fallen into a deep sleep, believing it was merely the result of the journey’s exhaustion.

“So that was why you were outside my room that night.”

“I had to be careful not to make a sound even when leaving. That man—no, Captain Song—was still awake until dawn even after taking the drug.”

Song Ilseom, who had been standing against the wall with his arms crossed, muttered expressionlessly.

“So that was a mind-clouding drug. No wonder I felt so tired that day. Next time, use something better. Though I don’t know whether you’ll have a next time.”

*What a goddamn bastard.*

Heo Jun barely managed to swallow the curse that rose to his lips and looked at Ju Hwaran.

“Hwangbo Eom, that old man, threatened me. He said that if I didn’t switch the Thousand-Year Snow Ginseng, he would kill me and my family and wipe out the Yongbong Escort Bureau. I only wanted to protect everyone!”

“Then you made the wrong choice.”

“You’re right. I once went to Hyung’s sickbed, crying as I confessed everything. But… but I couldn’t undo the mistake.”

“Your mistake?”

At the mention of her father, Ju Hwaran’s eyes trembled—but only for an instant.

She soon shook her head slightly.

“No. You’re wrong. It wasn’t a mistake. It was a choice, Uncle.”

“Hwaran…!”

“My father used to tell me that every choice comes with responsibility. Although he failed to make the family business he inherited prosper, he never once regretted his choices.”

Heo Jun suddenly realized that the conflict and wavering he had seen in Ju Hwaran’s eyes were gradually disappearing.

*Could it be?*

No. It could not be.

This could not be happening!

Tears and cold sweat streamed down Heo Jun’s cheeks.

He desperately raised his voice.

“Give me one chance! Just one last chance! I’m your father’s one and only sworn younger brother, and your uncle, aren’t I? Hwaran, for the sake of the bond we’ve shared, please!”

“The bond we’ve shared, you say?”

“Yes. I shared both good and bad with Hyung for thirty years. If your father were here—if it were him—he wouldn’t take my life this easily!”

“Uncle Heo. No, Chief Escort Heo Jun.”

Heo Jun, who had been repeatedly smashing his head against the floor, lifted his head in a daze.

The eyes of his niece were there.

They were eyes he had never seen before—cold eyes with not a trace of hesitation left in them.

“You’re right. If my father were here, he would have forgiven you. But…”

A low voice continued toward the frozen Heo Jun.

“I am not Junzi Sword Ju Hogun. I am Dagger Hidden Flower Ju Hwaran.”

And in the next moment, silver sword light filled Heo Jun’s vision.

Swish! Rip!
